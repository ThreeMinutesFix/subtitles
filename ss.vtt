THE REST OF THE HOUSE.

536
00:32:00.333 --> 00:32:02.266
(Corrie)
THE PARLOR. . .

537
00:32:08.367 --> 00:32:11.667
MEALTIMES-- THAT'S
A FAVORITE HOUR FOR A RAID.

538
00:32:13.567 --> 00:32:15.867
WATCH YOUR WASTEBASKETS. . .

539
00:32:16.867 --> 00:32:18.734
AND ASHTRAYS.

540
00:32:21.967 --> 00:32:24.567
WE NEED TO BE AS HIGH
AS POSSIBLE.

541
00:32:24.567 --> 00:32:27.867
IT ALLOWS FOR THE BEST CHANCE
TO REACH A SAFE PLACE

542
00:32:27.867 --> 00:32:29.867
WHILE THEY SEARCH BELOW.

543
00:32:32.533 --> 00:32:35.066
THESE ARE ALL BEDROOMS?

544
00:32:35.066 --> 00:32:36.533
YEAH.

545
00:32:37.533 --> 00:32:39.800
IF A RAID COMES AT NIGHT,

546
00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:41.967
THEY'LL HAVE TO
TAKE THEIR BEDDING,

547
00:32:41.967 --> 00:32:44.934
BUT MAKE CERTAIN
THE MATTRESS GETS TURNED.

548
00:32:44.934 --> 00:32:47.433
A FAVORITE TRICK OF THE GESTAPO

549
00:32:47.433 --> 00:32:49.533
FEELING FOR A WARM SPOT
ON THE BED.

550
00:32:49.533 --> 00:32:51.734
WHAT'S UP THERE?

551
00:32:55.133 --> 00:32:56.367

552
00:33:01.934 --> 00:33:03.934
AH-HA!

553
00:33:03.934 --> 00:33:06.000
THE ROOF IS DIRECTLY ABOVE.

554
00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.000
WHO SLEEPS HERE?

555
00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.667
I DO.

556
00:33:09.667 --> 00:33:12.200

559
00:33:18.367 --> 00:33:22.934

[loud splashing]

561
00:33:36.533 --> 00:33:39.533
ALL CLEAR! THE SIGN'S
IN THE WINDOW.

562
00:33:39.533 --> 00:33:47.400
[loud splashing]

563
00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:50.233
YOU SEE, THERE IS
A DISTINCTIVE MARKING--

564
00:33:50.233 --> 00:33:53.800
YOU CAN ALWAYS TELL
FLENSTADHT WORK.

565
00:34:00.967 --> 00:34:02.700
PETER!

566
00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:04.333
LOVELY DAY,
AUNT BETSIE.

567
00:34:04.333 --> 00:34:06.467
PETER!
NO, NO.

568
00:34:08.867 --> 00:34:10.867
I'LL COME FOR IT

569
00:34:10.867 --> 00:34:12.467
GOOD.

570
00:34:13.766 --> 00:34:16.967
AH! HERR TEN BOOM!

571
00:34:18.967 --> 00:34:21.567
FRIESSIAN!

572
00:34:21.567 --> 00:34:25.065
SUCH BEAUTIFUL WOOD!

573
00:34:25.065 --> 00:34:28.567
MY FATHER MADE A CASE
LIKE THIS ONCE.

574
00:34:28.567 --> 00:34:33.367
OH, HE SPENT MONTHS BUILDING IT,
POLISHING. . .OILING.

575
00:34:33.367 --> 00:34:36.900
IT AH. . .IS JUST A SHELL. . .

576
00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:39.632
IT NEEDS
A COMPLETE SET OF WORKS.

577
00:34:39.632 --> 00:34:42.900
WHAT PRICE WILL YOU BE ASKING?

578
00:34:44.967 --> 00:34:50.065
WELL, IT WILL TAKE
SOME MONTHS TO BE READY.

579
00:34:50.065 --> 00:34:53.033
NAME A GOOD PRICE.

580
00:34:53.033 --> 00:34:56.166
EXORBITANT, EVEN,
I'LL PAY.

581
00:34:58.767 --> 00:35:01.433
I LIKE THE CLOCK.

582
00:35:01.433 --> 00:35:03.967
I CAN AFFORD THE BEST!

583
00:35:03.967 --> 00:35:07.166
BUT IT, IT HAS NO WORKS.

584
00:35:07.166 --> 00:35:09.033
NONE.

585
00:35:09.033 --> 00:35:12.533
VERY WELL.

586
00:35:12.533 --> 00:35:17.367

AUNT BETSIE, HOW MANY TIMES

592
00:35:34.333 --> 00:35:37.033
TAKE THE SIGN OUT OF THE WINDOW

593
00:35:37.033 --> 00:35:38.734
WHEN IT ISN'T SAFE!!

594
00:35:38.734 --> 00:35:42.100
OH, KIK, I'M SORRY.

595
00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:45.200
I'M SORRY!!

596
00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:46.367

00:36:24.667 --> 00:36:26.367
PAINT?

606
00:36:26.367 --> 00:36:28.767
(Corrie)
BETSIE! OH, BETSIE.

607
00:36:28.767 --> 00:36:32.166
DO YOU REMEMBER
FRED KOONSTRA?

608
00:36:32.166 --> 00:36:34.166
OF COURSE. . .

609
00:36:34.166 --> 00:36:36.800
HE READ OUR
ELECTRIC METER FOR YEARS.

610
00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:38.800
HIS DAUGHTER WAS
IN OUR BIBLE CLASS.

611
00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:40.900

612
00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:42.133

PAINT! ELSIE KOONSTRA.

614
00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:48.533
I KNOW HER NAME.

615
00:36:48.533 --> 00:36:51.433
I JUST HAD TO SORT
OUT A FEW FACES.

616
00:36:51.433 --> 00:36:54.367
SHE MUST BE IN HER
TWENTIES BY NOW.

617
00:36:54.367 --> 00:36:58.300
(Corrie)
I HEARD YESTERDAY THAT FRED
KOONSTRA WORKS AT THE FOOD
OFFICE.

618
00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:00.266
WHERE?

619
00:37:00.266 --> 00:37:03.233
(Corrie)
THEY ISSUE RATION CARDS.

00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:15.200
[bird singing]

621
00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:17.467
I WILL BE FRANK.

622
00:37:17.467 --> 00:37:20.200
WE'VE HAD SOME UNEXPECTED
COMPANY.

623
00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:24.967
FIRST, A BABY. . .
THEN A MAN. . .

624
00:37:24.967 --> 00:37:28.000
AND NOW LAST NIGHT, A COUPLE.

625
00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:32.066
ALL JEWS, MR. KOONSTRA.

626
00:37:32.066 --> 00:37:35.233
WHY DO YOU TELL ME?

627
00:37:35.233 --> 00:37:40.500
THERE ARE ONLY THREE
OF US LEFT AT HOME NOW--

628
00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:43.633
MY FATHER, MY SISTER, AND ME,

629
00:37:43.633 --> 00:37:47.100
AND OUR RATION CARDS
ARE JUST NOT ENOUGH.

630
00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:49.934
ALL RATION CARDS ARE CHECKED.

631
00:37:49.934 --> 00:37:52.567
ACCOUNTED FOR IN
A DOZEN DIFFERENT WAYS.

632
00:37:52.567 --> 00:37:57.133
YEAH! YEAH! I. . .I KNOW.

633
00:37:57.133 --> 00:37:59.166
I. . .

634
00:37:59.166 --> 00:38:02.166
I SHOULD NOT HAVE ASKED YOU.

635
00:38:04.533 --> 00:38:09.266
(sighs) I THOUGHT PERHAPS
YOU COULD ADVISE ME.

636
00:38:09.266 --> 00:38:12.166
THE FOOD OFFICE AT UTRECHT
WAS ROBBED LAST WEEK.

637
00:38:12.166 --> 00:38:14.867
THE MEN WERE CAUGHT

638
00:38:14.867 --> 00:38:16.800
. . .AND SHOT.

639
00:38:18.667 --> 00:38:21.467
(nervously)
IF IT HAPPENED
AT NOON,

640
00:38:21.467 --> 00:38:25.000
WHEN JUST THE RECORD CLERK
AND I WERE THERE. . .

641
00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:30.166
WE'D HAVE TO BE
TIED AND GAGGED.

642
00:38:33.033 --> 00:38:35.467
HOW MANY CARDS DO YOU NEED?

643
00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:39.000
A HUNDRED!

644
00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:42.700

47 SECONDS!

657
00:39:28.533 --> 00:39:31.467
THEY BETTER NOT SEND US
ANYONE WIDER THAN ME.

658
00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:33.967
HALLELUJAH!

659
00:39:33.967 --> 00:39:39.500

HERREN, IT IS NOT KOSHER.

663
00:39:46.233 --> 00:39:48.100
IT'S NOT IMPORTANT.

664
00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:50.000

WOULD YOU PASS
THE POTATOES, PLEASE?

AH!
IT'S LONG ENOUGH

681
00:40:40.166 --> 00:40:42.033
TO CURDLE THE STOMACH.

(demanding tone)
I WAS TOLD YOU HAD
ACCOMMODATIONS.

690
00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:12.700
I WILL REQUIRE A ROOM TO MYSELF

QUIET FOR STUDY,
PREFERABLY WITH NO CHILDREN.

692
00:41:14.767 --> 00:41:17.433
WELL, CAN YOU TAKE ME IN?

693
00:41:17.433 --> 00:41:19.266
WELL, YES. . .
GOOD.

694
00:41:19.266 --> 00:41:22.100
. . .I SUPPOSE SO, BUT THERE ARE
MANY QUESTIONS THAT I. . .

695
00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:25.100
I WOULD LIKE
SOMETHING TO EAT.

696
00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:30.500
THE LAST MEAL WAS YESTERDAY--
THANK YOU--AT NOON.

697
00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:34.967
THIS IS A KOSHER HOUSE?

698
00:41:34.967 --> 00:41:36.967
WELL, WE TRY.

699
00:41:36.967 --> 00:41:39.333
WE HAVE MANY REQUESTS
THAT WE'RE NOT ABLE TO FILL.

700
00:41:39.333 --> 00:41:41.166
THERE ARE
NO CHILDREN?

00:41:43.934 --> 00:41:46.500
BUT THEY COME
AND THEY GO.

703
00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:49.166
LET THEM STAY GONE
WHILE I AM HERE.

704
00:41:49.166 --> 00:41:51.166
THIS THE WAY?

705
00:41:51.166 --> 00:41:53.734
YEAH! BUT I WOULD FIRST LIKE
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT. . .

706
00:41:53.734 --> 00:41:56.567
MY CONTACTS HAVE TOLD ME THAT
MOSTOF YOUR QUESTS ARE TRANSIENT

707
00:41:56.567 --> 00:41:59.200
THEY ARE ON THEIR WAY
OUT OF THE COUNTRY.

708
00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:00.834
MOST OF THEM, YES.

709
00:42:00.834 --> 00:42:02.633
WELL, I WILL NOT BE.

710
00:42:02.633 --> 00:42:06.533
I'M A TEACHER
AND CHIEF CANTOR FOR
THE CONGREGATION BETH KODESH.

WHO IS THIS MAN?. . .
A PARTRIARCH LIKE ISAAC

714
00:42:16.166 --> 00:42:18.233
OR JACOB,
