2
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:40,310
War.

3
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:44,390
<i>It's been a part of humanity in every age.</i>

4
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,980
<i>We fight for power,</i>

5
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:48,820
<i>for riches,</i>

6
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,270
<i>for rights or for freedom.</i>

7
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:56,580
<i>There always seems to be
something to fight for.</i>

8
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:01,500
<i>But one thing has remained
true of every war.</i>

9
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:07,790
<i>Behind the field of battle,
someone has developed a strategy.</i>

10
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:13,800
<i>This was part of my husband's role
in the army.</i>

11
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:16,880
<i>He would look at what the enemy was doing,</i>

12
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,720
<i>then begin putting together the resources</i>

13
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:22,600
<i>and a plan to fight against them.</i>

14
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,180
<i>He was a crucial part of this process</i>

15
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:30,070
<i>until a heart attack claimed his life.</i>

16
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:36,410
<i>That was a hard time for me and our son.</i>

17
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:43,580
<i>I was reminded that death
is a part of life,</i>

18
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:48,250
<i>and that the life we're given
should never be taken for granted.</i>

19
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:55,260
<i>It's been 40 years since Leo passed,</i>

20
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,770
<i>but I still hold on to the many lessons
I learned from that time.</i>

21
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:08,810
<i>I find myself amazed that
of the many battles we engage in today,</i>

22
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:13,110
<i>be it money, control or
matters of the heart,</i>

23
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,610
<i>very few of us
know how to fight the right way,</i>

24
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:21,990
<i>or understand
who we're really fighting against.</i>

25
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,580
<i>To win any battle,</i>

26
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:29,080
<i>you've got to have
the right strategy and resources,</i>

27
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:33,880
<i>because victories don't come by accident.</i>

28
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,320
Hey, Mom, I gotta go. Yeah.

29
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,700
All right, okay. Bye.

30
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:01,120
Jason and David, get rid of the ball
and help me with these boxes!

31
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:03,660
Om.

32
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:08,250
Oh! I am so sorry.
You must be Elizabeth Jordan.

33
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:10,250
- I am. And you're Melissa?
- Yes.

34
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:12,830
I'm sorry. We just started packing.

35
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,750
Oh, no problem. Can I help you with that?

36
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:16,840
Honey. Honey, I gotta be
in Knoxville at 2:00.

37
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:20,340
Uh, but I finished the closet.
That was in the refrigerator.

38
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:24,140
- Real estate agent.
- Software rep.

39
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,260
How did you know that?

40
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,220
It's on that folder
you're holding in your hand.

41
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:30,020
I would love to stay.
I'm very sorry I have to leave.

42
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,150
My wife can answer everything
about the house.

43
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:35,700
We realize it's a disaster
and we've agreed to blame it on the kids.

44
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:37,770
- So, I'll call you later.
- Love you!

45
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,860
I understand. My husband does
the same thing. Pharmaceuticals.

46
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,450
Oh. Does he ever get tired of the travel?

47
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:46,910
No, I do not.

48
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,330
I enjoy the drive.

49
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:50,370
Well, we're excited
to do business with you, Tony.

50
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:52,960
- Hey, tell Coleman I said hello.
- I'll do it.

51
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,760
And, uh, thanks for the new driver.

52
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:56,000
Hey, you enjoy it, okay?

53
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,210
- I will.
- All right.

54
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:58,420
Good to see you.

55
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,720
Gentlemen, we'll be in touch.

56
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,770
I see you made the sale.

57
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:10,100
- Of course.
- I'm impressed.

58
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:13,190
Most guys run out
with their tail between their legs.

59
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:14,820
I'm Tony Jordan.

60
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:17,820
Veronica Drake. I work for Mr. Barnes.

61
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:20,210
I'll be your contact for the purchase.

62
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,110
Okay. Well, Veronica Drake,

63
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:25,570
I guess I'll be seeing you again
when I return in two weeks.

64
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,530
I look forward to it.

65
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:36,010
Mom?

66
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,460
I'm in here, Danielle.

67
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,090
Here's my last report card.

68
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,180
I still got one C.

69
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:49,550
Oh, baby. You have an A in everything else.

70
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,860
One C in math is not that bad.

71
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:54,150
At least you get a break
for the summer, right?

72
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,650
Is that your feet?

73
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:59,730
I'm sorry, baby, I ran out of foot powder.

74
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,570
That smells terrible!

75
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:05,620
I know, Danielle. I just needed
to take my shoes off for a minute.

76
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:08,790
That's, like, awful.

77
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:10,580
Well, don't just sit there looking at them.

78
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,780
Why don't you give me a hand
and rub them right there?

79
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:14,710
Ew. No way.

80
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:18,010
Girl, go set
the table for dinner.

81
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,550
When your daddy gets home,
you can show him your report card. Okay?

82
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,970
- Yes, ma'am.
- All right.

83
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,140
I just heard him pull in, Danielle.

84
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,090
Will he be mad about my C?

85
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:34,430
I already told you, baby,
a C is not that bad. It's okay.

86
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:38,730
Hey, Daddy.

87
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:39,900
Hey, Danielle.

88
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:44,530
I got my last report card.
I made all A's except for one C.

89
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:47,110
So, I just got a notification
that you moved $5,000

90
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:49,620
from our savings
into your checking account.

91
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,120
That better not be
so you can prop up your sister again.

92
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,620
You just gave that much money
to your family last month.

93
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:56,840
And my sister needs it
more than your parents do.

94
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:58,410
My parents are elderly. Okay?

95
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,620
Your sister married a bum,

96
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,580
and I'm not supporting someone
who's too lazy to work.

97
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:03,590
Darren is not a bum.

98
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:06,000
He's just having a
hard time finding a job.

99
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:07,200
Liz, he is a bum.

100
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:10,220
Look, I can't even remember
the last time he had a job.

101
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,420
Can we talk about this later?

102
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,980
No, we'll talk about it now.

103
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,980
Because if you want to give them
what you make, that's fine.

104
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,730
- But you're not giving them my money.
- Your money?

105
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:23,530
The last time I checked,
we both put money into that account.

106
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:27,200
And the last time I checked,
I make four times what you do.

107
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,000
So you don't move a cent out of that
account without asking me first.

108
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:34,370
Can we please just eat dinner?

109
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:39,420
You know what? Go ahead.

110
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,510
I'm going to the gym.

111
00:07:58,850 --> 00:07:59,900
Oh!

112
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:19,210
Ballgame!

113
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:21,920
- Whoo-hoo!
- That was sick, man! That was sick.

114
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:28,920
- You all right, dog?
- Yeah. Why?

115
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,600
You look like you're playing
a little mad tonight.

116
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:33,470
So? You know that means I play better.

117
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,190
Better means ball hog?

118
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:39,480
Dude, I can't get a pass from you.
It'd be easier to baptize a cat.

119
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,020
I just needed to blow off
a little steam. Okay?

120
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,100
- Well, I hope you're done.
- I gotta go.

121
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:46,760
Yo, yo, yo, you're
coming to church, right?

122
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:47,380
Maybe.

123
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:49,070
Maybe means no.

124
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,990
Hey, Tony, man. You gotta hit me one.

125
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:53,040
Come on, man. I gotta go.

126
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:54,970
Dude, I just told all these guys.
Just one.

127
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:57,620
Watch this.

128
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:01,410
Told you!

129
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:05,630
The favor of God can't be bought,
traded or manipulated.

130
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:07,590
Because people still come to church

131
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:10,550
with their hearts
totally distant from the Lord.

132
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:12,880
But they think they could put on
their Sunday best,

133
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:16,470
and throw a super spiritual smile
on their face and impress God.

134
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:22,350
God is looking for people
who will seek him with a whole heart.

135
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:26,560
So it all comes down to this.
We either seek Him or we don't.

136
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,570
And God surely knows the difference
between the two, and so should we.

137
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,740
Danielle, I have to meet a client
in the morning,

138
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:36,240
so I'm going to drop you off early
at the community center, okay?

139
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,870
Okay. Can we pick up Jennifer on the way?

140
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:41,410
Sure, if it's okay with her mother.

141
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:42,790
Who's Jennifer?

142
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,750
She's on my Double Dutch team.

143
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,560
I thought you were playing basketball.

144
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,510
I wanted to jump rope again.

145
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:51,090
Tony, you should go see her practice
tomorrow. She's really very good.

146
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:52,800
I'm out of town this week.

147
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:56,930
When were you gonna tell me?

148
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:59,220
I just did.

149
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:05,850
Tony, I know you're
the company's top salesman,

150
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:09,030
but in order for this family to function,
we have to communicate.

151
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:11,110
I thought you'd be here this week.

152
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:13,780
Well, if you want to continue to live
in this house, I have to make sales.

153
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,740
And that means being flexible.

154
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,540
Aren't you a little too old
to be jumping rope?

155
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,670
Here you go.

156
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:38,800
Now there's 5, 10, 15, 20.

157
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:42,260
And here's 5 extra 'cause
I like your haircut.

158
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:43,510
Thank you, Ms. Williams.

159
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,070
I'm tired of seeing all these young boys
with sloppy hair

160
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,860
and pants around their knees.

161
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:52,160
- A man wears his pants around his waist.
- Yes, ma'am.

162
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:56,330
Well, tell your mama I said hello.
And I'll see you next week.

163
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,570
- Yes, ma'am. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

164
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,410
Ms. Williams?

165
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:01,780
That's me.

166
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,790
You must be Elizabeth.

167
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:05,740
Well, it's so good to meet you.

168
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:07,450
You can call me Clara.

169
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:10,130
Well, come on in.
Let me show you the house.

170
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:13,550
I got to put my coffee pot on.
Can I get you something?

171
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:15,630
Oh, no, thank you. I had mine at home.

172
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:18,420
This is a beautiful house.

173
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:20,390
I think so, too.

174
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,770
Built in 1905.

175
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:25,310
And I've lived here almost 50 years.

176
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:29,440
Leo added that sun porch on the back
all by himself.

177
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,310
Oh, this must be Leo.

178
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:36,240
That's Leo.

179
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:40,280
We were married for 14
years before he died.

180
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:44,330
He had just been promoted to captain
before that picture was taken.

181
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:47,370
He was so handsome in that uniform.

182
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,120
He's fine, ain't he?

183
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:53,550
Yes, we wanted five or six children,

184
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:58,050
but the Lord only gave us Clyde,
'cause he was all I could handle.

185
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:01,100
You see that big crack
over there on the wall?

186
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:02,680
That was Clyde.

187
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:06,430
Now, this is my third favorite place.

188
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,140
It's my sitting room.

189
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:11,890
- Hmm. What do you do in here?
- Mainly sit.

190
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:17,190
Well, come on in here.
Let me show you the dining room.

191
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:22,950
Now this is my second favorite place.

192
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:25,700
I love this room.

193
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,630
This is beautiful.

194
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,170
And I love this fireplace.

195
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:33,130
I've got a lot of good memories in here.

196
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:34,670
Yes, I do.

197
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:37,090
Lot of laughter.

198
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:40,460
And a few tears, too.

199
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:46,310
Now this is why I'm moving in with Clyde
a few blocks away. Ooh!

200
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,690
It's getting harder to
negotiate these stairs.

201
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:54,030
Okay, so three bedrooms and two full baths.

202
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,900
- Do you mind if I take some pictures?
- Oh, go ahead, that's fine.

203
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,190
Oh, you got one of those smart phones.

204
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:03,070
I've been meaning to get me one of those.

205
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:06,120
Can't do nothing with my phone
but call folks.

206
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,700
Must be a dumb phone.

207
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:12,460
- You got it?
- I do.

208
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:15,790
They say if you live in a house
with stairs, you'll live longer.

209
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:18,090
So I should make it to 180.

210
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:21,380
This is fascinating, Ms. Clara.

211
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:24,550
Oh, that's my Wall of Remembrance.

212
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:28,430
And when things aren't going so well,
I look back on it,

213
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:32,770
and I'm reminded that God
is still in control.

214
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,020
It encourages me.

215
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:38,020
I sure could use some of that.

216
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:41,230
Oh. I'm sorry.

217
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,320
Okay. So, I've got
a few questions about utilities,

218
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,160
and then we should probably talk
about the asking price.

219
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,280
All right.

220
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,330
Okay. So, I think I got everything
that I need for now.

221
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:50,910
So nice to meet you, Ms. Clara.

222
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,380
Listen, if you're available tomorrow,

223
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:55,170
I'd like to come by and show you
some comparisons in the area.

224
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:58,300
Well, why don't you come by for coffee
tomorrow morning

225
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:00,720
and we'll talk about it then? Say 10:00?

226
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:05,390
Ah. Okay. Yeah, I can do that.
I'll see you at 10:00.

227
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:09,940
By the way, what's your most favorite room?

228
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,520
I'll tell you tomorrow.

229
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:15,110
Then I look forward to tomorrow.

230
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:21,110
Mmm-hmm.

231
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:24,820
How you doing?

232
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:26,610
- Mr. Jordan?
- Yes.

233
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:27,930
- Samples closet?
- Yes, please.

234
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:29,790
- Right this way.
- All right.

235
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:34,040
You can just use the third shelf down
and just leave the door open,

236
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,560
- and I'll come back and get it later.
- All right. Thank you.

237
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,230
You must be Mr. Jordan.

238
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,730
Dr. Morris, yes. I'm Tony Jordan,
Brightwell Pharmaceuticals.

239
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:57,900
We met last March.

240
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,270
- I remember. How are you?
- I'm doing fine.

241
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:03,450
I saw your write-up on new stimulants
and you showed interest in Predizim.

242
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,450
So I just left you a case
in your samples closet.

243
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:07,200
Oh, that's fantastic. I appreciate that.

244
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,540
Oh, it's no problem.
You'll easily find them.

245
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,180
It's the third shelf, blue caps.

246
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:14,330
Now what I need you to do though,
is just sign this receipt.

247
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:16,750
And it just shows that
I left them with you.

248
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:19,110
Now, Dr. Morris, if you need any more,
you just let me know

249
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,600
and I'll be glad to bring some over.

250
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,090
Thank you, Tony. We'll try them out.

251
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:24,170
All right. Sounds good.
We'll see you again.

252
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:24,690
Right.

253
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,220
And I'll be looking forward
to that next article.

254
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,640
Thank you.

255
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:30,930
And he thinks
it's my sister's fault.

256
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:32,560
Can you even believe that?

257
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:36,140
Well, if my man said that to me,
I'd be angry, too.

258
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:38,100
We don't fight that much anymore.

259
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:41,150
After 31 years of stalemates, girl,
it just is not worth it.

260
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:42,650
Oh, I wouldn't put up with it.

261
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:45,230
His money became your money
the minute he said, "I do."

262
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,700
So I'd give it to my sister anyway.

263
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,530
I don't even like my sister.

264
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:51,700
Just be careful, Elizabeth.

265
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:53,980
You do not want World War Ill
to break out in your home.

266
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,700
No. No, I don't.

267
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:59,380
But there are days, Mandy. There are days.

268
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,920
It's hard to submit to a man like that.

269
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,600
You know what my mama used to say to me?

270
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:07,550
She used to say that sometimes submission
is learning to duck

271
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:08,880
so God can hit your husband.

272
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,220
Hmm. It's tough being a woman.

273
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:14,050
You got that right.

274
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:35,080
Veronica, this is Tony Jordan.

275
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:38,330
We met a few days ago
after I met with Mr. Barnes.

276
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:40,750
Hey, listen, uh, I'll be coming
through town next week

277
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:44,050
and I was wondering if you could
recommend a couple of nice restaurants.

278
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,880
Feel free to call me back at this number.

279
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,630
Take care.

280
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,060
I appreciate you coming
this morning.

281
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:00,890
Coffee will be ready
in a couple of minutes.

282
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,050
Oh, sounds good.

283
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,070
I ran a sales report from the area.

284
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:07,110
I wrote down a suggested asking price
for the house.

285
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,610
Mmm-hmm.

286
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:11,900
Well, what do you think?

287
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:13,580
Mmm-hmm.

288
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:18,160
Now, what did you say
your husband did for a living?

289
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,790
Um, well, we actually haven't talked
about that,

290
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:23,960
but he's a sales rep
for Brightwell Pharmaceuticals.

291
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,460
Mmm-hmm.

292
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:28,630
And where did you say you attended church?

293
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:32,550
Well, we occasionally attend
Riverdale Community.

294
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:33,970
Mmm-hmm.

295
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,890
So you would say you know the Lord.

296
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:38,310
Yes! I would say I know the Lord.

297
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:42,230
You think the Lord is okay
with this asking price?

298
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:43,810
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

299
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,940
And you have children?

300
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:51,370
Ms. Clara, my husband, Tony, and I
have been married for 16 years.

301
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,740
We have one daughter.
Her name is Danielle and she's 10.

302
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:58,160
She enjoys pop music and ice cream
and jumping rope.

303
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:01,540
Oh. Well, that's good to know.

304
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:05,710
Now, you say
you attend church occasionally.

305
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:09,590
Is that because your pastor
only preaches occasionally?

306
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:13,420
Ms. Clara, I really would like to help you
sell your house.

307
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,930
That's why I'm here.

308
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:18,760
As far as my faith is concerned,
I believe in God, just like most people.

309
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,270
He's very important to me.

310
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:24,220
Mmm-hmm. Well, let me get our coffee.

311
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:30,700
So, if I asked you
what your prayer life was like,

312
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:33,610
would you say that it was hot or cold?

313
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:37,610
I don't know that I would say it's hot.

314
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:42,000
I mean, we're like most people.
We have full schedules. We work.

315
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:45,790
But I would consider myself
a spiritual person.

316
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:49,720
I'm not hot, but I'm not cold either.
Just, you know, somewhere in the middle.

317
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:51,210
Here you go.

318
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:56,220
- I've got cream or sugar if you need it.
- Oh, no, thank you. I like it black.

319
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,400
Ms. Clara, you like your coffee
room temperature?

320
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:07,650
No, baby, mine's hot.

321
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:12,280
Elizabeth,

322
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:16,230
people drink their coffee hot or cold,

323
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:20,200
but nobody likes it lukewarm,
not even the Lord.

324
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:22,410
Point taken, Ms. Clara.

325
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:24,990
But why do you feel the need
to examine my personal life?

326
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,750
Because I've been where you are.

327
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:31,760
And you don't have to step
on the same land mines that I did.

328
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,800
That's a waste of time.

329
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:37,460
And this asking price is just fine.

330
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,260
Let me get you a hot cup of coffee.

331
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:46,100
I was a little sneaky last time.

332
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:57,320
What land mines do you think
I might step on?

333
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,320
You tell me.

334
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:06,130
Now, if there was one thing in your life
that you could make better,

335
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:08,160
what would it be?

336
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:10,210
Just one?

337
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,210
Well, I'd probably have to say my marriage.

338
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:15,960
If there's one thing we
do well, it's fight.

339
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:18,140
No, I don't think you do.

340
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,890
I'm sorry?

341
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:24,640
Just because you argue a lot
doesn't mean that you fight well.

342
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:28,640
Every couple has some friction
every now and then.

343
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:32,820
But I bet that you never
feel like you've won

344
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:35,440
after you've had an argument
with your husband.

345
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:42,040
Can I ask you how much
you pray for your husband?

346
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,250
Uh...

347
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,450
Well, very little.

348
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,000
Elizabeth,

349
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:55,500
I think it's time for me to show you
my favorite place in this house.

350
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,850
Now, this is where I do my fighting.

351
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:11,350
A closet?

352
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,770
I call it my war room.

353
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:31,870
So...

354
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,710
So, you wrote prayers
for each area of your life?

355
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,250
A prayer strategy. Yes.

356
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:40,630
Now, I used to do
what you and your husband are doing,

357
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:42,710
but it got me nowhere.

358
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:46,930
And then I really started studying
what the scriptures say.

359
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:51,640
And God showed me that it wasn't my job
to do the heavy lifting. No.

360
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:54,940
That was something that only He could do.

361
00:21:55,310 --> 00:22:00,320
It was my job to seek Him, to trust Him
and to stand on His word.

362
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:04,830
Ms. Clara, I've never
seen anything like this.

363
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:07,580
And I admire it, I really do. I just...

364
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,370
I don't have time to pray
that much every day.

365
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:14,420
But you apparently have time
to fight losing battles with your husband.

366
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:17,420
Elizabeth,

367
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:21,760
if you will give me one hour a week,

368
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:27,380
I can teach you how to fight the right way
with the right weapons.

369
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:34,600
Since you're good with the asking price,
I'll go ahead and list the house.

370
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:38,110
I'd, uh...
Like to think about our other discussion.

371
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:43,530
Elizabeth, please forgive me
for being so direct,

372
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:46,870
but I see in you a warrior

373
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:49,120
that needs to be awakened.

374
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:53,950
But I will respect
whatever decision you make.

375
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:56,460
Thank you, Ms. Clara.
I hope you have a good day.

376
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:57,630
You, too.

377
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:05,930
Don't let me push too hard, Lord.

378
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:08,470
I know I got a big mouth.

379
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:31,910
If they do that stunt
in the competition, they'll win.

380
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:34,870
Why don't you ask your dad
about helping us get uniforms?

381
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:36,950
He's not here.
It's not like he would care anyway.

382
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,760
Can you ask your mom?
My mom already gave part of the money.

383
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,920
Come on, we can go to my room.

384
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:50,600
So, I told my dad
that he could jump with us,

385
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:52,520
and he totally started laughing.

386
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:55,310
He said he would only do it
if Mom did it with him,

387
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:57,610
which, of course, she would never do.

388
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:01,440
So, they, like, start talking
about doing the worst routine ever.

389
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,860
Like, in a funny way.

390
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:05,940
And she starts laughing so hard,
her face turned bright red.

391
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:08,740
Then she starts squeaking
'cause she couldn't breathe.

392
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:10,540
It was hilarious.

393
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,620
I wish I lived at your house.

394
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:15,700
Whenever my parents are together,
they just fight.

395
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:24,000
Jennifer, how's your family?

396
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:25,710
Fine.

397
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,440
Would you like to stay for dinner?
You're welcome to eat with us.

398
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,050
Okay.

399
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:34,010
Okay, well, I'm gonna go change.

400
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:37,060
I'll call you girls down in a few minutes.

401
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:29,440
Danielle...

402
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:36,450
You know we love you, right?

403
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:40,790
That wasn't very convincing.

404
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:46,290
Well, I think you love me a little bit.

405
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:48,130
A little bit?

406
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,800
Danielle, you're my daughter.

407
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,420
You're the most important thing
in the whole world to me.

408
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:54,930
You gotta believe that.

409
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,300
What's my team name?

410
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:01,690
Urn...

411
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,140
The Firecrackers.

412
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:05,280
That was last year.

413
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,150
What are our colors?

414
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:17,910
What jump rope tricks
did I just learn to do?

415
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,750
Who's my new coach?

416
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:31,540
What award did I win last week on my team?

417
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:36,670
You won an award last week?

418
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,680
Danielle, I'm so sorry.

419
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:46,560
I'm so sorry.

420
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:52,360
I'm so sorry.

421
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,450
I'm sorry.

422
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:11,930
Well, good morning.

423
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:15,090
Her heart is just breaking
and I was completely unaware.

424
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:17,890
Tony, he's completely unaware.

425
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:20,060
That man is running out of time, Ms. Clara.

426
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:22,730
He's off in his own world
being top salesman somewhere

427
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,650
while his daughter is growing
more and more calloused to him every day.

428
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,770
He shows no interest in
anybody but himself.

429
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:30,730
And another thing. I don't
have proof of this,

430
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:33,990
but if he's not getting it from me,
he's got to be getting it from somebody.

431
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:36,410
He makes all these little flirtatious
comments to other women...

432
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,530
Uh, uh, uh. Elizabeth, just so I know,

433
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:43,570
how much of the one hour
we got together today

434
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:46,330
are you gonna spend
whining about your husband?

435
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:49,960
And how much we gonna spend
on what the Lord can do about it?

436
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:54,290
I'm sorry, Ms. Clara. I just get so
wound up the more I think about it.

437
00:27:54,710 --> 00:28:00,090
Your thoughts about your husband
are almost entirely negative, aren't they?

438
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:01,930
He acts like an enemy to me.

439
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:05,310
See, you're fighting the wrong enemy.

440
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:09,730
Now, your husband certainly has his issues,
but he's not your enemy.

441
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:13,200
When I fought against my husband,

442
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:17,620
I was fighting against my own marriage
and my family.

443
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:22,370
Now, I tried for years to fix Leo,
but I couldn't do it.

444
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:24,540
Well, I haven't got anywhere with Tony.

445
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:26,910
'Cause it's not your job.

446
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:31,510
Who said that it was your responsibility
to fix Tony?

447
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:36,640
It's your job to love him, to respect him
and to pray for the man.

448
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,960
God knows he needs it.

449
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:43,220
And men don't like it when
their woman's always trying to fix them.

450
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:45,310
Elizabeth,

451
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:51,150
you got to plead with God
so that He can do what only He can do.

452
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:55,150
And then you got to get out of the way
and let Him do it!

453
00:28:57,690 --> 00:28:59,490
I don't even know where to start.

454
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:01,110
Here.

455
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:05,460
You will find some of my
favorite scriptures in here.

456
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:09,200
They were my battle plan
to pray for my family.

457
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:11,210
You can start with that.

458
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:18,550
<i>Mmm, hey, hey, hey.</i>

459
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:19,920
<i>Said you been bound up.</i>

460
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,350
<i>Lookin' for a way to break free.</i>

461
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:24,340
<i>Devil's had you tied up.</i>

462
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:26,890
<i>Listen to these words from me.</i>

463
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:29,310
<i>Your situation may seem hopeless.</i>

464
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:31,270
<i>- But it's not the end.
- Oh, yeah.</i>

465
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:34,940
<i>Though you are burdened
and have shackles on your feet.</i>

466
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:40,320
<i>Now, I want you to know
You're about to break loose.</i>

467
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,950
<i>You're about to break loose.</i>

468
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:44,620
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

469
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:49,620
<i>Jesus took the keys and gave 'em to you.</i>

470
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:52,120
<i>So here's what you gotta do.</i>

471
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:56,170
<i>Shake loose
Everything that binds you up.</i>

472
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:57,300
<i>Who told you.</i>

473
00:29:57,370 --> 00:29:59,130
<i>Who told you that you can't make it.</i>

474
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:02,260
<i>When God says that you can shake it
Shake loose.</i>

475
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:04,930
<i>Everything that binds you up.</i>

476
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:09,890
<i>- Praise Him like it's your last chance.
- Get up and do the David dance.</i>

477
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:13,390
<i>Shake yourself loose.</i>

478
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:15,100
Mom?

479
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:16,710
I'm in here, Danielle.

480
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:31,200
Mom, are you okay?

481
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:33,790
Yes. What do you need?

482
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:38,290
Why are you eating chips in the closet?

483
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:41,430
I'm just having some private time. Okay?

484
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,930
Okay.

485
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:47,640
Um, Jennifer wanted to know
if I could spend the night.

486
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:50,970
I already did my chores,
and it's okay with her parents.

487
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,350
Okay, but I want you home
by lunch tomorrow. Okay?

488
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:57,110
- Yes, ma'am.
- And, Danielle,

489
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,530
don't tell anybody
I was eating chips in this closet.

490
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,700
Don't tell anyone my mom
was eating chips in the closet, okay?

491
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:09,500
- Who are you talking to?
- Jennifer.

492
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,450
Jennifer?

493
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:16,450
Yes, ma'am?

494
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:22,130
I'm asking you not to tell anybody
I was eating chips in my closet.

495
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:25,720
- Okay.
- Thank you.

496
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:29,800
What's that smell?

497
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,690
That would be my shoes, Jennifer.

498
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:36,310
And if you girls would kindly shut the
door, you won't have to smell it anymore.

499
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:46,900
Is she not allowed to eat chips?

500
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:50,160
I can have all the chips I want!
This is my house!

501
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,330
Great.

502
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:05,260
Hello, Tony. How are you?

503
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,930
- Julia, how're you doing?
- I'm doing well, thanks.

504
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,300
- Having a good day?
- I am, thank you.

505
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:12,560
Um, Coleman's expecting you
and Tom's in there, too.

506
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:13,680
Thanks for the heads up.

507
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,440
You're welcome. Right this way.

508
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:17,260
- All right, thank you.
- Mmm-hmm.

509
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:24,610
- Tony! How's my favorite rep?
- Real good. How're you doing?

510
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:26,570
- Heard we got the Holcombe account.
- Yes, we did.

511
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:29,780
- That's fantastic. You did it again.
- Appreciate that. Thank you.

512
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:32,450
Even Tom was impressed,
and you know that's hard to do.

513
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:34,080
- Good work.
- Thank you.

514
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:37,460
Look, I know you're on your way home,
but we just wanted to say thanks.

515
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:39,500
And you got a nice bonus check
coming your way.

516
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:41,170
- I like that.
- Yeah, you do.

517
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:42,870
- How's Elizabeth?
- She's good.

518
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,210
- Tell her I said hello.
- I'll do it.

519
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:45,840
- Good to see you.
- All right.

520
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:57,100
<i>Cynthia, it's not gonna do you
any good to fight about it.</i>

521
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:59,310
You can't get the job for him.

522
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:01,020
Well, is he trying at all?

523
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:04,020
Is he sending out resumes
or making calls, anything?

524
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:07,070
I know.

525
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:12,870
Well, I'm sorry, but he's making it hard,
not just on you but everybody around you.

526
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,260
No, I'm not saying that
we're not gonna help.

527
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,730
We're still talking about it.
Okay?

528
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,950
Listen, Tony just got home.
I need to call you later.

529
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:25,960
Yeah. I love you, too. Bye.

530
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,880
- How was your trip?
- It was good.

531
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,100
- I take it that was your sister.
- Yep.

532
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:36,720
Darren getting a job?

533
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:38,560
Not yet.

534
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:40,690
Not yet <i>as</i> in he's trying?

535
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:43,640
Or not yet as in he's still sitting
on the couch playing video games?

536
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,770
Tony, what he does is not Cynthia's fault.

537
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:48,860
Listen, she just needs one month's rent
and a car payment.

538
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:50,490
I think we should at least do that.

539
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:52,240
Cynthia married a loser. Okay?

540
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,320
That was her choice
when everybody told her not to.

541
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:57,330
- It is her fault.
- Tony, she cannot control him.

542
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:59,780
She's got a job, but it's not enough.

543
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:02,700
Listen, I'm not asking for $5,000 anymore.

544
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:05,460
I'm asking for one month's rent
and a car payment.

545
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:08,130
And the next month
you'll be asking for the same thing, Liz.

546
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:09,800
So the answer is still no.

547
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,350
And what is that smell in here?

548
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,930
I'm putting powder in my shoes.

549
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:19,390
- Well, can't you do that outside?
- Yes.

550
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:26,140
Tony, if you won't do it for her,

551
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:28,240
do it for me.

552
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:33,860
No.

553
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:12,860
- You got another bonus?
- Yes, sir.

554
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:16,200
Dude, I went in the wrong line of work.

555
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:20,950
Well, I couldn't have been a paramedic.

556
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:25,670
- You got that right, bro.
- And you too calm to be a salesman.

557
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:29,540
Yeah.
Yeah, but could you imagine

558
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:32,380
if I got bonuses
every time I saved somebody's life?

559
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:36,470
Ohhh! Check it out. Heimlich, $200.

560
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:39,770
Right? Um, CPR, $400.

561
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,890
Right.

562
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:44,020
Like $1,000, if they're ugly.

563
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:47,650
Dude, you remember that one lady who had
swallowed that garlic and she choked,

564
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,730
and I had to give her mouth-to-mouth?

565
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:52,310
- Yeah.
- That should've been a Hawaiian vacation.

566
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:55,280
- I couldn't have done it.
- Yeah. You could do it.

567
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:58,860
You're not gonna let somebody die
in front of you while you eat your salad.

568
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:04,000
I don't do CPR, Mike. I'd
have just called 911.

569
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:07,420
That's just cold.
You just gonna let somebody die?

570
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:09,500
Yo, what if it was your wife?

571
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:15,880
Hold on, brother. What? What's that?

572
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,090
- What is that?
- What's what?

573
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:21,090
Dude, what's up with you and Liz?

574
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:23,020
Nothing.

575
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:24,970
Nothing? Look at you getting all uptight.

576
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:27,490
You got extra veins popping out
that wasn't even there before.

577
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:31,860
Mike, I'm just tired of her. Okay?
All right? I said it.

578
00:36:32,770 --> 00:36:35,020
- I'm just tired of her junk.
- Her junk?

579
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:38,530
Dude, you married her, junk and all.

580
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:41,860
It's not some sort of buffet where you
get to pick and choose what you want.

581
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:43,450
You get all of her, bro.

582
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:45,870
And you better not have somebody

583
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:47,420
on the side.

584
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,670
So, you're trying to do CPR
on my personal life now?

585
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:54,750
Okay. Yeah, I'm a paramedic.
But I'm also a Christian,

586
00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:58,050
which means I help people
while I'm helping people.

587
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:02,060
Mike, look, we've been friends
for a long time,

588
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:04,480
but some things
are just none of your business.

589
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:06,930
True, and since we've been friends
a long time,

590
00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:09,260
I'm not just gonna watch your marriage die.

591
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:12,650
So if it's bleeding,
I'm not gonna keep eating my salad.

592
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:24,240
I'll see you in church.

593
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:28,080
I'd like to see the church in you, bro.

594
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:38,760
Hey, somebody need to come move this.

595
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,890
This was a treat for me, Elizabeth.

596
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:50,270
I enjoy coming here.
And your daughter is precious.

597
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:52,140
She is.

598
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:56,650
You know, there are days
I wish she had a brother or sister.

599
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:59,490
We were just too busy chasing our careers.

600
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:02,950
I don't know that that
was a wise thing to do.

601
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:05,030
You don't enjoy your job?

602
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:08,910
Oh, there are days I do. Sold a house
this morning, so that was good.

603
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:13,410
I'd just rather have a good marriage
than more money.

604
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,960
Mom! Can we go get ice cream?

605
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,960
They sell it right over there.

606
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,880
Ms. Clara, would you like some ice cream?

607
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:23,090
I'll tell you what.

608
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:28,010
If you go get the ice cream
and let your mother walk me to the car,

609
00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:30,890
- I'll pay for it.
- Oh, no, no, no. I'm paying for it.

610
00:38:30,970 --> 00:38:35,270
And rob me of a blessing?
I'm paying, we're all eating.

611
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:39,200
And I'll take two scoops
of Butter Pecan, please. In a cup.

612
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,020
I'll have one scoop
of Cookies and Cream, okay?

613
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:43,150
And listen, just stay right there,

614
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:45,610
'cause we're gonna pull the car around
and pick you up at the entrance.

615
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:49,290
Okay. Can I have strawberry sherbet with
gummy worms and chocolate syrup on top?

616
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:51,330
Ugh!

617
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:53,660
So, what does a normal week
in your life look like?

618
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:57,170
Well, my son drops in for an hour or two
during the week.

619
00:38:57,250 --> 00:39:00,300
I go grocery shopping,
an occasional doctor's visit,

620
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:05,050
and my girlfriends and I get together
on Friday afternoons for coffee.

621
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:09,380
Other than that, I read a lot
and I spend time with Jesus.

622
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:10,640
I used to spend so much time

623
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,720
with my girlfriends before my job...

624
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,730
Give me your money right now.

625
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:16,400
Did you hear me?
Both of you, give it to me now.

626
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:18,270
Okay. Okay, we will.
Just please, put the knife down.

627
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:19,650
Do it, and do it now!

628
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:21,690
No.

629
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:27,030
Now you put that knife down right now
in the name of Jesus.

630
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:37,160
And you believe he was early 20s?

631
00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:39,130
Yeah. Maybe 25.

632
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,710
So, let me get this straight.

633
00:39:42,290 --> 00:39:44,510
He was pointing a knife at you

634
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:48,220
and you told him to put it down
in Jesus' name?

635
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:52,220
Right. Now when you write that down,
don't leave out Jesus.

636
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:54,810
People always leaving Jesus out.

637
00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:57,520
That's one of the reasons
we're in the mess we in.

638
00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:02,440
Yes, ma'am.

639
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:05,570
You know, what concerns me
is that you could've easily been killed.

640
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:09,950
Well, I know a lot of people probably
would've given him their money.

641
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:13,000
I understand that, but
that's their decision.

642
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:19,050
Are you not eating your
ice cream, Elizabeth?

643
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,590
No. I'm not hungry anymore.

644
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:25,510
Well, let me help you with that. No
reason to waste perfectly good ice cream.

645
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:31,840
Mmm!

646
00:40:32,090 --> 00:40:36,020
Oh, oh, oh! Now that's good! Mmm-hmm.

647
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:43,240
I'm sorry, I just thought
I should call Tony.

648
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:44,900
I understand.

649
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:46,610
You'd think he'd be more alarmed.

650
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:48,410
He just kept saying
that since we were all okay,

651
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,610
I should just calm down.

652
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:52,290
I'm having trouble
calming down myself.

653
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,160
Really? You seemed calm earlier.

654
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:57,740
Yeah, but I got a huge sugar-rush
from all that ice cream.

655
00:40:57,830 --> 00:41:01,670
I feel like I can run around
the block a few times.

656
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:03,250
Oh. Uh...

657
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:07,460
While we on the subject of Tony,
I have something for you to do.

658
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:08,590
What's that?

659
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:13,430
I want you to write down everything
that you can think of that he's done wrong.

660
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:16,970
Ms. Clara, if I did that,
I'd be writing a long time.

661
00:41:17,050 --> 00:41:19,180
Well, then just write down the highlights.

662
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:21,890
And I'll be back to check on you
in a little while.

663
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:39,040
Well, that's almost three pages.

664
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:42,000
And I could write more, but you'll
get the gist of it when you read it.

665
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:44,300
Actually, I'm not gonna read it.

666
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:48,130
My question to you is this.

667
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:53,920
In light of all these wrongs,
does God still love Tony?

668
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:57,930
We both know he does.

669
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:59,390
Do you?

670
00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:02,730
Now, Ms. Clara, you're meddling.

671
00:42:05,350 --> 00:42:10,200
There's love in my heart for Tony, but it's
just buried under a lot of frustration.

672
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:13,160
- So he needs grace.
- Grace?

673
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:15,280
I don't know that he deserves grace.

674
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:17,110
Do you deserve grace?

675
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:22,340
Ms. Clara, you have a habit of backing
me up in a corner and making me squirm.

676
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:24,160
I felt the same way.

677
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:29,210
But the question still remains.
Do you deserve grace?

678
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:34,800
The Bible <i>says</i> that no one is righteous,
not even one.

679
00:42:35,170 --> 00:42:40,600
For we have all sinned.
So, really, none of us deserve grace.

680
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:44,680
But we all still want God's forgiveness.

681
00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:48,610
Elizabeth, it comes down to this.

682
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:52,570
Jesus shed his blood on the cross.

683
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:57,830
He died for you.
Even when you did not deserve it.

684
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:02,080
And He rose from the grave
and offers forgiveness and salvation

685
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:05,330
for anyone who turns to Him.

686
00:43:06,370 --> 00:43:08,420
But the Bible also says

687
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:13,170
that we can't ask Him to forgive us
while refusing to forgive others.

688
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:16,930
I know, Ms. Clara.
But that's just so hard to do.

689
00:43:17,010 --> 00:43:19,600
Yes, it is. Yes, it is.

690
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,180
But that's where grace comes in!

691
00:43:22,510 --> 00:43:24,690
He gives us grace!

692
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:29,570
And He helps us to give it to others,
even when they don't deserve it.

693
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:33,160
We all deserve judgment.

694
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:40,040
And that is what a holy God gives us when
we don't repent and believe in His Son.

695
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:47,550
I had to forgive Leo for some things,
and it wasn't easy.

696
00:43:47,870 --> 00:43:49,370
But it freed me.

697
00:43:49,790 --> 00:43:56,010
Elizabeth, there's not room for you
and God on the throne of your heart.

698
00:43:56,090 --> 00:43:59,760
It's either Him or it's you.
You need to step down.

699
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:05,350
Now, if you want victory,
you're gonna have to first surrender.

700
00:44:05,850 --> 00:44:07,140
But, Ms. Clara,

701
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:12,650
do I just back off and choose to forgive
and then just let him walk all over me?

702
00:44:12,730 --> 00:44:17,860
God is a good defense attorney.
Trust it to Him.

703
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:22,030
And then you can turn your focus
to the real enemy.

704
00:44:22,110 --> 00:44:23,540
The real enemy?

705
00:44:23,610 --> 00:44:25,830
The one that wants to remain hidden.

706
00:44:25,910 --> 00:44:28,080
The one that wants to distract you

707
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:33,380
and deceive you and divide you
from the Lord and your husband!

708
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:35,430
You see, that's how he works.

709
00:44:36,290 --> 00:44:41,020
Satan comes to steal, kill and destroy.

710
00:44:41,090 --> 00:44:43,680
And he is stealing your joy.

711
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:48,860
He is killing your faith
and he's trying to destroy your family.

712
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:54,100
If I were you,
I would get my heart right with God.

713
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:58,700
And you need to do your fighting in prayer!

714
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:04,870
And you need to kick the real enemy
out of your home with the word of God.

715
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:08,290
It's time for you to fight, Elizabeth.

716
00:45:08,910 --> 00:45:11,630
It's time for you to
fight for your marriage!

717
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:14,500
It's time for you to fight the real enemy!

718
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:18,510
It's time for you
to take off the gloves and do it!

719
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:42,080
<i>There's no magic in the location you pray.</i>

720
00:45:42,150 --> 00:45:47,530
<i>But scripture does say to go
into your inner room and pray in secret.</i>

721
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:53,210
<i>And your heavenly Father, who sees
what's done in secret, will reward you.</i>

722
00:45:53,830 --> 00:45:59,340
<i>Now get rid of any distractions
and focus your heart and mind on Him.</i>

723
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:04,180
<i>Acknowledge that He is God,
and that you desperately need Him.</i>

724
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:11,230
<i>Now, be grateful for your blessings,
but lift your needs and requests to Him.</i>

725
00:46:11,850 --> 00:46:15,190
<i>If you've got something to confess,
then confess it.</i>

726
00:46:15,270 --> 00:46:18,860
<i>Ask Him for forgiveness.
Then choose to believe Him</i>

727
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:22,440
<i>when He says that He loves you
and will take care of you.</i>

728
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:25,780
<i>Then pray for the heart of your husband,</i>

729
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:30,290
<i>your daughter and anyone else
that the Lord brings to your mind.</i>

730
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:32,450
<i>And don't rush it.</i>

731
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:37,040
<i>You take your time, and then you listen.</i>

732
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:45,410
God...

733
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:50,080
God, I need you.

734
00:47:54,370 --> 00:47:56,710
I know I haven't prayed like I should.

735
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:03,840
I know that I haven't...
I haven't followed you like I should.

736
00:48:05,290 --> 00:48:07,510
But I need you, right now.

737
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,980
Lord, I've been so angry at Tony,

738
00:48:15,810 --> 00:48:19,310
<i>and I'm still so angry at him.</i>

739
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:25,700
But I don't want to lose my marriage.

740
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:33,080
Lord, forgive me.

741
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:36,280
Forgive me.

742
00:48:37,370 --> 00:48:39,500
I'm not his judge, you are.

743
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,420
But I'm asking you, please,

744
00:48:45,670 --> 00:48:48,420
please don't let him do this.

745
00:48:57,930 --> 00:48:59,020
Take over.

746
00:49:01,310 --> 00:49:02,940
Please, take over.

747
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:11,030
Take my heart and take all this anger.

748
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:15,740
Help him love me again.

749
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:21,410
And help me love him.

750
00:49:26,250 --> 00:49:30,680
If he's doing something wrong,
don't let him get away with it.

751
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:35,600
<i>Stand in his way.</i>

752
00:49:36,590 --> 00:49:38,640
I'm asking you, please,

753
00:49:40,430 --> 00:49:41,900
to help me.

754
00:50:00,950 --> 00:50:04,550
"The thief comes only to steal"

755
00:50:05,330 --> 00:50:07,500
"to kill and destroy."

756
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:13,430
"But I've come that you may have a life,
and have it abundantly."

757
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,520
"But the Lord is faithful."

758
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:24,560
"He will strengthen
and protect you from the evil one."

759
00:50:29,230 --> 00:50:31,200
"Submit to God."

760
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:34,620
"Resist the devil,"

761
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:38,870
"and he will flee."

762
00:50:43,990 --> 00:50:45,500
"Submit to God."

763
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:54,430
"Resist the devil, and he will flee."

764
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:59,470
"Submit to God."

765
00:51:02,930 --> 00:51:04,480
"Resist the devil,"

766
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:09,320
"and he will flee."

767
00:51:41,930 --> 00:51:44,230
I don't know where you are, Devil,

768
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:47,230
but I know you can hear me.

769
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:52,310
You have played with my mind

770
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:55,490
and had your way long enough.

771
00:51:58,530 --> 00:52:00,150
<i>No more.</i>

772
00:52:01,610 --> 00:52:03,290
You are done!

773
00:52:12,370 --> 00:52:15,220
Jesus is the Lord of this house.

774
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:19,970
And that means there's no place
for you here anymore.

775
00:52:21,550 --> 00:52:27,930
So take your lies, your schemes
and your accusations,

776
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:31,900
and get out in Jesus' name!

777
00:52:41,490 --> 00:52:43,540
You can't have my marriage.

778
00:52:43,610 --> 00:52:45,660
You can't have my daughter.

779
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:48,160
And you sure can't have my man.

780
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:53,220
This house is under new management
and that means you are out!

781
00:53:04,050 --> 00:53:05,520
And another thing.

782
00:53:05,590 --> 00:53:10,320
I am so sick of you stealing my joy,
but that's changing, too.

783
00:53:10,390 --> 00:53:12,690
My joy doesn't come from my friends.

784
00:53:12,770 --> 00:53:14,860
It doesn't come from my job.

785
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:17,360
It doesn't even come from my husband.

786
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:19,910
My joy is found in Jesus.

787
00:53:20,610 --> 00:53:24,280
And just in case you forgot,
he has already defeated you.

788
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:30,370
So go back to Hell where you belong
and leave my family alone.

789
00:53:48,390 --> 00:53:50,480
You know what I'd really like right now?

790
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:51,820
Tell me.

791
00:53:52,470 --> 00:53:54,600
A glass of my favorite wine.

792
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:57,770
Okay, we can do that. What is it?

793
00:53:58,770 --> 00:54:00,320
It's not here.

794
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:02,490
It's at my apartment.

795
00:54:04,150 --> 00:54:07,250
Well, if it's your favorite,
I'd like to try it.

796
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:11,330
Here you are, sir.
Hope you both have a wonderful evening.

797
00:54:11,410 --> 00:54:13,660
Thank you. We will.

798
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:26,510
Veronica, listen.

799
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:31,350
I need a minute. All right?
I'll be right back.

800
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:33,850
Okay.

801
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:53,370
Mom?

802
00:55:17,980 --> 00:55:19,150
Danielle?

803
00:55:19,230 --> 00:55:21,360
What happened to your closet?

804
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:38,260
I'm doing something
I should've done a long time ago.

805
00:55:39,790 --> 00:55:41,670
I'm learning how to pray

806
00:55:43,210 --> 00:55:44,460
and fight

807
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:46,640
and trust.

808
00:55:47,710 --> 00:55:49,680
By cleaning out your closet?

809
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:52,180
No. Well, yes. But no.

810
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:55,390
I mean, it needed to be cleaned out.

811
00:55:56,140 --> 00:55:58,610
But that's not why I did it. I did it...

812
00:55:59,810 --> 00:56:01,360
I did it to fight in prayer.

813
00:56:01,850 --> 00:56:03,700
You're fighting God?

814
00:56:03,770 --> 00:56:05,370
No, I'm not...

815
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:08,160
Well, sometimes I do fight God.

816
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:11,490
But I shouldn't 'cause He always wins.

817
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:16,210
So, you know, I'm praying
for God to fight for me

818
00:56:16,290 --> 00:56:18,130
'cause I am just sick of losing.

819
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:21,420
But not against God.
I need to lose against God.

820
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:25,000
I'm sick of losing in other areas
where I'm just fighting

821
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:27,680
but I just keep losing all the time.

822
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:30,010
It's exhausting.

823
00:56:31,170 --> 00:56:34,720
So I'm learning how not to fight God

824
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:37,980
and how to let Him fight for me
so that we can all win.

825
00:56:38,470 --> 00:56:39,820
Does that make any sense?

826
00:56:40,180 --> 00:56:41,480
No.

827
00:56:43,810 --> 00:56:46,820
You know what?
I don't make much sense when I'm tired.

828
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:48,990
You must be really tired.

829
00:56:50,570 --> 00:56:53,240
Let's just go get a late night snack. Okay?
And I'll try it again.

830
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:54,620
Okay.

831
00:57:06,130 --> 00:57:08,380
<i>How many storms have I been through.</i>

832
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:11,520
<i>How many led me right to You.</i>

833
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:14,310
<i>You're using the pain, the hardest days.</i>

834
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:17,010
<i>For my good, my good.</i>

835
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:20,440
<i>So what do I fear
God, You are with me.</i>

836
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:23,110
<i>Guiding my steps today.</i>

837
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:25,900
<i>Through the mountains, valleys
sun and rain.</i>

838
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:29,150
<i>Lord, lead the way Lead the way.</i>

839
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:32,450
<i>I will follow, I will press on.</i>

840
00:57:32,530 --> 00:57:35,330
<i>Even when the walk feels long.</i>

841
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:40,380
<i>Your hands hold me together
Your love is with me forever...</i>

842
00:57:40,450 --> 00:57:43,380
Now see, you're already influencing
your daughter.

843
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:45,920
This can change everything for her.

844
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:50,470
I admit, when I first started praying in
there, 10 minutes seemed like an eternity.

845
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:52,840
Now I have a hard time
even wanting to leave.

846
00:57:52,970 --> 00:57:55,220
<i>One step in front of the other.</i>

847
00:57:56,470 --> 00:57:58,390
<i>I'm gonna press on, press on.</i>

848
00:58:28,750 --> 00:58:30,300
Oh. Hello.

849
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:31,470
Whoa. Urn...

850
00:58:32,590 --> 00:58:34,760
I just need you to sign for this package.

851
00:58:36,590 --> 00:58:38,840
Oh. Thank you so much.

852
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:42,770
This is a present for my daughter.
I can't wait to give it to her.

853
00:58:42,850 --> 00:58:45,650
Well, I hope it takes your breath away.

854
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:50,770
Have a nice day, ma'am.

855
00:58:59,110 --> 00:59:02,330
- I like it. And you got one, too?
- Yep, I sure did.

856
00:59:02,410 --> 00:59:05,250
And you can write your prayer requests
in there, your favorite verses.

857
00:59:05,330 --> 00:59:08,380
- We can journal, anything we want.
- Hey, Daddy.

858
00:59:08,460 --> 00:59:09,700
- Hey, Danielle.
- Hey.

859
00:59:09,710 --> 00:59:11,710
I didn't think you were coming home
till tonight.

860
00:59:11,790 --> 00:59:15,050
Yeah. I finished up everything
pretty early, so...

861
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:18,720
- You got enough for me?
- Sure.

862
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:21,100
Jennifer's mom is coming
to pick Danielle up in a few minutes,

863
00:59:21,180 --> 00:59:23,430
- but you and I can eat.
- All right.

864
00:59:24,220 --> 00:59:26,480
- I'll take my stuff to the room.
- All right.

865
00:59:39,490 --> 00:59:42,240
- Hey, how are you?
- I'm good. How are you?

866
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:43,750
You and the girls
hanging out today?

867
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:46,000
Yeah. We're gonna go
to the park for a couple hours,

868
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:47,080
and then I thought we could grab

869
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:49,590
a milkshake at Chick-fil-A's,
if that's okay?

870
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:13,940
So, what's been going on here?

871
01:00:14,020 --> 01:00:16,070
Oh. Well, I sold another house on Tuesday.

872
01:00:16,150 --> 01:00:18,200
And I already told you
about getting held up, so...

873
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:20,160
Yeah, look, about that.

874
01:00:21,610 --> 01:00:23,460
It's not that I didn't care.

875
01:00:25,450 --> 01:00:27,040
I just got really busy,

876
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:28,720
so when I saw that you were all right...

877
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:32,300
I understand. It's all right. I'm sorry
for getting so worked up about it.

878
01:00:32,540 --> 01:00:33,590
You're sorry?

879
01:00:33,670 --> 01:00:37,140
Yeah. I knew you were at work,
probably in a meeting.

880
01:00:37,210 --> 01:00:39,810
I should've just waited
till later to bring it up.

881
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:42,810
My mind was just racing,
so I took it out on you.

882
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:45,760
But you know what?
I really think it was good for Danielle.

883
01:00:45,850 --> 01:00:49,820
I think it helped her to realize how important
it is to be aware of who's around you, so...

884
01:00:50,850 --> 01:00:52,230
You want hot sauce?

885
01:00:53,270 --> 01:00:56,070
- Yeah, that's fine.
- You want mild or Wrath of God?

886
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:58,700
I don't want Wrath of God.
Let me have the other one.

887
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:14,710
What do you want, Liz?

888
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:19,430
- You mean, right now?
- Yeah.

889
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:24,300
Well, I would kill for

890
01:01:25,430 --> 01:01:26,930
a hot fudge sundae.

891
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:28,890
Just

892
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:31,940
fudge everywhere.

893
01:01:32,770 --> 01:01:35,240
And two scoops of ice cream,
Cookies and Cream.

894
01:01:36,940 --> 01:01:40,740
Whipped cream. Just mounds,
mounds of whipped cream on top.

895
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:45,330
And one cherry. One cherry.

896
01:01:47,620 --> 01:01:49,490
And my feet are killing me.

897
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:51,330
Man, I would love a foot rub.

898
01:01:56,920 --> 01:01:58,840
Liz, I'm not rubbing your feet.

899
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:00,970
Okay.

900
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:03,470
Well, you wanna pray?

901
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:05,970
Yeah.

902
01:02:08,140 --> 01:02:09,980
God, we thank you for this food.

903
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:13,110
And we thank you
for taking care of our family.

904
01:02:14,310 --> 01:02:16,400
- Amen.
- Amen.

905
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:18,320
I'm starving. Let's eat.

906
01:02:23,030 --> 01:02:24,700
Mmm. It's good.

907
01:02:29,660 --> 01:02:30,960
And you double checked your numbers.

908
01:02:31,030 --> 01:02:34,080
<i>Twice.
Tony's inventory is off, Rick.</i>

909
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:35,580
<i>We saw the same thing last week</i>

910
01:02:35,660 --> 01:02:37,170
<i>when he left Asheville.</i>

911
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:41,010
<i>He may just be padding numbers,
but there's a pattern here.</i>

912
01:02:42,590 --> 01:02:44,930
<i>You're the district manager.
You gotta cal! This in.</i>

913
01:02:45,010 --> 01:02:48,850
- Yeah. Thanks, Greg.
- Sorry, man. Later.

914
01:02:59,230 --> 01:03:00,320
Why, Tony?

915
01:03:10,070 --> 01:03:11,920
Hey, Danielle. Where's Daddy?

916
01:03:11,990 --> 01:03:14,960
He left.
He got a call from his boss and had to go.

917
01:03:15,870 --> 01:03:17,620
- From Rick?
- I think so.

918
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:20,970
- Did he say when he'd be back?
- No, ma'am.

919
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:25,300
Oh, I hear him.

920
01:03:54,410 --> 01:03:55,660
Hey.

921
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:04,840
Tony?

922
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:07,260
First off,
I don't want any grief from you. Okay?

923
01:04:07,340 --> 01:04:09,930
'Cause I'm really not in the mood
to talk about this right now.

924
01:04:14,260 --> 01:04:15,890
Tony, what's going on?

925
01:04:18,100 --> 01:04:19,520
I just lost my job!

926
01:04:28,610 --> 01:04:31,330
Okay. So, we'll just do what we gotta do.

927
01:04:31,780 --> 01:04:33,780
What, no sarcastic comment?

928
01:04:36,830 --> 01:04:38,290
Tony, I think we'll be fine.

929
01:04:38,950 --> 01:04:41,710
Liz, you heard me, right? I just got fired!

930
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:47,010
Okay? So that means no income.
No company car. No health coverage.

931
01:04:47,090 --> 01:04:49,010
We can't even afford this house anymore.

932
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:54,430
I understand.

933
01:04:54,510 --> 01:04:58,560
Listen, I'll just pick up some new properties
while you look for a different job. Okay?

934
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:03,770
So, that's it?

935
01:05:05,310 --> 01:05:06,820
You just gonna roll with it?

936
01:05:08,730 --> 01:05:10,610
What else am I supposed to do?

937
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:15,670
Sometimes I don't get you, Liz.

938
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:20,000
I'll go start dinner.

939
01:05:34,590 --> 01:05:35,680
Tony!

940
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:38,980
Please help me! Please!

941
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:40,890
Tony!

942
01:05:41,770 --> 01:05:43,690
Tony, help me, please!

943
01:05:46,810 --> 01:05:47,940
Tony!

944
01:05:49,150 --> 01:05:51,320
Tony, no! No!

945
01:06:24,230 --> 01:06:25,650
Danielle, have you seen my gym bag?

946
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:27,650
No, sir.

947
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:07,600
<i>" Lord, I pray for Tony,
that you would turn his heart back to you."</i>

948
01:07:08,100 --> 01:07:12,480
<i>"Help me to love him,
and give him a fresh love for me."</i>

949
01:07:12,570 --> 01:07:14,990
<i>"I surrender my rights to you as Lord"</i>

950
01:07:15,070 --> 01:07:20,750
<i>"and ask you to bless him as he honors you
and to expose him if he walks in deceit."</i>

951
01:07:20,820 --> 01:07:24,290
<i>"Build him up as the man
you intend him to be."</i>

952
01:07:24,370 --> 01:07:29,130
<i>"Help me to support and respect him.
I ask for your help to love him."</i>

953
01:07:29,420 --> 01:07:31,710
<i>"In Jesus' name I pray."</i>

954
01:07:31,790 --> 01:07:32,920
Daddy?

955
01:07:34,380 --> 01:07:37,010
I found your gym bag
next to the washing machine.

956
01:07:37,090 --> 01:07:39,640
Okay. You can just set it
right there, Danielle.

957
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:44,060
Hey, Danielle.

958
01:07:46,930 --> 01:07:49,030
When did Mama do this to her closet?

959
01:07:49,730 --> 01:07:51,950
Hmm, a few weeks ago.

960
01:07:58,320 --> 01:08:02,200
- So, the whole closet was empty?
- Yeah, except the papers on the wall.

961
01:08:03,870 --> 01:08:05,350
And what did she do with her clothes?

962
01:08:05,490 --> 01:08:09,090
Mike, I don't know, man. Some other closet.
What does that matter?

963
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:11,760
Dude, I don't think you understand
how important this is.

964
01:08:11,830 --> 01:08:15,380
When was the last time you heard
of a woman giving up some closet space?

965
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:21,100
All I know is, you can fight against
your wife and probably hold your own.

966
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:22,430
But if God is fighting for her,

967
01:08:23,850 --> 01:08:25,560
you can hit the gym all you want to, bro.

968
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:28,150
It's not looking good for you.

969
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:30,610
Man!

970
01:08:31,310 --> 01:08:33,480
I wish my wife would pray for me like that.

971
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:38,030
Plus, I could use the closet space.

972
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:42,950
All right, man, you good, yo.
I'm about to bounce.

973
01:08:43,030 --> 01:08:44,350
- See you later, bro.
- All right.

974
01:08:51,870 --> 01:08:52,870
Excuse me.

975
01:08:53,330 --> 01:08:55,550
Can you tell Danielle
I'll be back to get her after practice?

976
01:08:55,630 --> 01:08:56,840
- Sure, I'll tell her.
- All right.

977
01:08:56,920 --> 01:08:58,260
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

978
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:50,980
<i>Tony! Please help me! Please!</i>

979
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:40,780
<i>Jesus,</i>

980
01:10:44,280 --> 01:10:45,870
I'm not a good man.

981
01:10:55,160 --> 01:10:57,010
I'm selfish.

982
01:11:01,250 --> 01:11:02,670
I'm prideful.

983
01:11:08,510 --> 01:11:10,480
And I'm hurting this family.

984
01:11:12,350 --> 01:11:14,970
But this, this is not who I wanted to be.

985
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:19,480
I don't like the man I've become,

986
01:11:22,570 --> 01:11:24,530
but I don't know how to fix it.

987
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:28,950
I don't know what to do.

988
01:11:34,330 --> 01:11:36,170
Forgive me, please.

989
01:11:44,420 --> 01:11:46,050
Forgive me, Jesus.

990
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:09,490
One, two, three, go.

991
01:12:09,570 --> 01:12:11,320
Left, left, right.

992
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:14,790
Left, left, right.

993
01:12:18,290 --> 01:12:19,380
Yes! Go!

994
01:12:26,550 --> 01:12:28,170
One, two, three.

995
01:12:28,590 --> 01:12:30,090
Left, left, right.

996
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:34,390
Hey, you know what?

997
01:12:36,390 --> 01:12:39,190
I thought your jump roping routine
was gonna be something simple.

998
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:42,600
But it wasn't. It's pretty difficult.

999
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:47,870
But you were really good, Danielle.
I mean, I was impressed.

1000
01:12:49,690 --> 01:12:51,040
You're really good.

1001
01:12:51,990 --> 01:12:53,110
Thanks.

1002
01:13:03,080 --> 01:13:04,930
Daddy, why are they here?

1003
01:13:05,630 --> 01:13:07,800
They've come to
get this car, Danielle.

1004
01:13:14,430 --> 01:13:15,640
Excuse me.

1005
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:22,980
- Rick.
- Tony.

1006
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:24,820
I'm sorry about this.

1007
01:13:25,310 --> 01:13:26,490
It's not your fault, Rick.

1008
01:13:26,980 --> 01:13:29,530
Listen, I need you to sign
that we came for the car.

1009
01:13:29,980 --> 01:13:31,700
And clean out any items that belong to you.

1010
01:13:32,110 --> 01:13:33,660
Yep.

1011
01:13:34,070 --> 01:13:35,290
Already did.

1012
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:38,710
You're a talented guy, Tony.

1013
01:13:39,990 --> 01:13:41,340
I was sorry to see this happen.

1014
01:13:43,330 --> 01:13:44,830
- You take care.
- Yeah.

1015
01:13:46,330 --> 01:13:48,510
Why are they taking Daddy's car?

1016
01:13:49,090 --> 01:13:51,130
We'll talk about it later, baby, okay?

1017
01:13:51,210 --> 01:13:52,260
Listen, why don't you go inside

1018
01:13:52,340 --> 01:13:55,010
and knock out some chores
before lunch, all right'? Okay.

1019
01:14:12,110 --> 01:14:14,780
I picked up a couple more houses
to sell this morning.

1020
01:14:14,860 --> 01:14:17,960
Asked Mandy to give me everything
she could for the next couple months.

1021
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:20,280
That's good, Liz.

1022
01:14:22,290 --> 01:14:23,460
Can we talk?

1023
01:14:24,250 --> 01:14:25,340
Sure.

1024
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:38,520
I just don't understand
why you treat me this way.

1025
01:14:41,970 --> 01:14:44,150
When I told you what happened with my job,

1026
01:14:44,230 --> 01:14:45,650
I expected you to hit the ceiling, Liz.

1027
01:14:45,730 --> 01:14:49,400
So, in my mind, I was
ready to defend myself.

1028
01:14:52,820 --> 01:14:54,910
Except this time, I can't.

1029
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:00,240
And I hate saying this...

1030
01:15:05,250 --> 01:15:07,210
But I deserved to get fired.

1031
01:15:09,460 --> 01:15:10,760
I was deceiving them.

1032
01:15:13,170 --> 01:15:14,840
And I was deceiving you.

1033
01:15:20,390 --> 01:15:22,430
I almost cheated on you, Liz.

1034
01:15:26,060 --> 01:15:27,500
I thought about it.

1035
01:15:29,770 --> 01:15:31,150
I almost did it.

1036
01:15:36,280 --> 01:15:37,950
But you know all this.

1037
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:42,030
And you're still here.

1038
01:15:43,780 --> 01:15:45,660
Then I see your closet,

1039
01:15:48,500 --> 01:15:50,250
and the way you praying for me.

1040
01:15:53,750 --> 01:15:55,300
Why would you do that

1041
01:15:59,130 --> 01:16:01,390
when you see the type of man I've become?

1042
01:16:03,930 --> 01:16:05,770
'Cause I'm not done with us.

1043
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:10,860
I will fight for our marriage.

1044
01:16:12,520 --> 01:16:15,270
But I've learned that my contentment
can't come from you.

1045
01:16:17,320 --> 01:16:19,820
Tony, I love you.

1046
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:25,670
But I am His before I'm yours.

1047
01:16:27,450 --> 01:16:32,380
And because I love Jesus,
I'm staying right here.

1048
01:16:43,680 --> 01:16:45,810
I'm sorry, Liz.

1049
01:16:54,440 --> 01:16:56,190
I asked God to forgive me,

1050
01:16:58,230 --> 01:16:59,990
but I need you to forgive me.

1051
01:17:01,990 --> 01:17:04,290
I don't want you to quit on me, Liz.

1052
01:17:05,870 --> 01:17:07,030
I will.

1053
01:17:07,620 --> 01:17:09,920
I forgive you.

1054
01:17:11,290 --> 01:17:12,630
I forgive you.

1055
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:15,970
I'm sorry.

1056
01:17:16,630 --> 01:17:17,880
Thank you, Lord.

1057
01:17:26,140 --> 01:17:28,060
And this just happened now?

1058
01:17:28,470 --> 01:17:29,600
He did?

1059
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:32,060
Well, what'd he say?

1060
01:17:33,310 --> 01:17:35,650
Oh, sweet Jesus. Oh, Lord!

1061
01:17:36,060 --> 01:17:37,320
Oh. Oh!

1062
01:17:37,570 --> 01:17:42,320
See, I told you, Elizabeth.
I told you that God would fight for you.

1063
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:46,290
Oh, Jesus!
All right, baby, I'll talk to you soon.

1064
01:17:46,740 --> 01:17:50,670
Om.

1065
01:17:51,410 --> 01:17:55,540
Devil, you just got your butt kicked!

1066
01:17:56,790 --> 01:17:58,970
My God is faithful.

1067
01:17:59,380 --> 01:18:02,180
And my God is powerful.

1068
01:18:02,260 --> 01:18:04,810
And my God is in charge.

1069
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:08,610
You can't fire Him and He'll never retire!

1070
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:10,900
Thank you, Jesus. Glory Hallelujah!

1071
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:14,030
<i>My God is good.</i>

1072
01:18:14,100 --> 01:18:17,980
<i>My God is good, and He's faithful.</i>

1073
01:18:19,770 --> 01:18:20,950
Hey, Danielle.

1074
01:18:21,030 --> 01:18:22,120
Hey, Daddy.

1075
01:18:32,290 --> 01:18:34,250
Listen, I need to tell you something.

1076
01:18:38,920 --> 01:18:41,640
I don't think I've been
a very good dad to you.

1077
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:50,640
And I haven't been very loving
to your mother either.

1078
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:55,850
Urn...

1079
01:18:56,390 --> 01:18:58,240
I can do better, Danielle.

1080
01:18:59,150 --> 01:19:01,490
You both deserve better from me.

1081
01:19:04,360 --> 01:19:05,780
But you know what?

1082
01:19:06,650 --> 01:19:08,500
I've asked God to help me.

1083
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:11,500
And

1084
01:19:12,990 --> 01:19:14,590
I wanted to ask you

1085
01:19:15,910 --> 01:19:17,880
if you would forgive me

1086
01:19:18,750 --> 01:19:20,720
and give me another chance.

1087
01:19:22,710 --> 01:19:24,010
Think you can do that?

1088
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:34,640
Listen, I do love you, Danielle.

1089
01:19:37,310 --> 01:19:38,860
I love you too, Daddy.

1090
01:20:00,370 --> 01:20:03,090
<i>We're sorry. You have reached</i>
a <i>number that has been disconnected</i>

1091
01:20:03,170 --> 01:20:05,260
<i>or is no longer in service.</i>

1092
01:20:15,060 --> 01:20:18,230
Slow down, I'm old. You know, I'm old now.
Okay, here we go.

1093
01:20:20,060 --> 01:20:22,280
Okay! I'm in there!

1094
01:20:23,110 --> 01:20:24,450
- Keep going!
- You got it!

1095
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:26,650
Okay. I'm trying! My knees!

1096
01:20:26,730 --> 01:20:28,610
Here we go. Got the turn.

1097
01:20:28,690 --> 01:20:31,250
What's the other move, Danielle?
Okay, wait.

1098
01:20:31,660 --> 01:20:34,120
- Good grief!
- Daddy, why don't you jump with us?

1099
01:20:34,200 --> 01:20:35,870
Yeah, that would be awesome!

1100
01:20:35,950 --> 01:20:37,870
No, no. I don't think
they let parents do that.

1101
01:20:38,250 --> 01:20:41,250
Yeah, they do. But no parents
do 'cause they can't keep up.

1102
01:20:41,330 --> 01:20:43,330
- Oh, really?
- Dad, it's an open league.

1103
01:20:43,420 --> 01:20:45,760
You can jump in the freestyle competition.
They'll let you.

1104
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:49,010
Look, tell you what.
Let me think about it, okay?

1105
01:20:49,340 --> 01:20:50,820
Okay, I'll think about it. All right?

1106
01:20:50,840 --> 01:20:53,010
Now if I'm gonna do it, I wanna do
it right. So let's try it again.

1107
01:20:53,090 --> 01:20:54,770
Get it going. Get it going for me.

1108
01:20:54,850 --> 01:20:57,310
Okay, here we go. Here we go. Okay. Okay.

1109
01:20:57,390 --> 01:20:59,890
All right, here we go. Turn. And we turn...

1110
01:21:15,160 --> 01:21:16,250
Tony?

1111
01:21:25,130 --> 01:21:26,630
Tony, what are you doing?

1112
01:21:29,380 --> 01:21:30,720
I'm struggling-

1113
01:21:35,470 --> 01:21:36,640
With What?

1114
01:21:47,150 --> 01:21:48,320
What is this?

1115
01:21:49,900 --> 01:21:51,320
It was my bonus plan.

1116
01:21:52,610 --> 01:21:53,990
Where did you get these?

1117
01:21:55,910 --> 01:21:59,380
I've been keeping some for myself
each time I take samples to a client.

1118
01:22:01,160 --> 01:22:03,120
I thought they had to sign
for what you gave them.

1119
01:22:03,250 --> 01:22:05,120
There's ways around that, Liz.

1120
01:22:08,090 --> 01:22:10,130
Tony, you gotta take these back.

1121
01:22:10,670 --> 01:22:12,840
Liz, I could be prosecuted for this.

1122
01:22:18,050 --> 01:22:19,930
Look, I've already lost my job.

1123
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:24,280
So, now I'm supposed to go and tell
Danielle her daddy might be going to jail?

1124
01:22:28,270 --> 01:22:30,150
Then why are you struggling?

1125
01:22:46,620 --> 01:22:48,050
What you have there
is fourth-quarter projections.

1126
01:22:48,130 --> 01:22:49,730
Now, if anything's off on that, don't...

1127
01:22:49,790 --> 01:22:52,260
Coleman, Tony Jordan's here to see you.

1128
01:22:54,670 --> 01:22:56,850
- Do you know what he wants?
- He didn't say.

1129
01:22:56,930 --> 01:22:59,220
Just said he wants five
minutes of your time.

1130
01:23:06,390 --> 01:23:09,490
Tony? Coleman's waiting for you
in the conference room.

1131
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:11,610
Thank you.

1132
01:23:28,500 --> 01:23:29,720
Hello, Tony.

1133
01:23:31,250 --> 01:23:32,750
Coleman. Tom.

1134
01:23:34,420 --> 01:23:36,590
Look, I appreciate you
guys meeting with me.

1135
01:23:37,260 --> 01:23:40,480
I just need to bring you something back
that belongs to the company,

1136
01:23:40,550 --> 01:23:41,900
and apologize for taking it.

1137
01:23:42,850 --> 01:23:44,270
What's in the box?

1138
01:23:55,320 --> 01:23:57,370
You weren't just padding your numbers,

1139
01:23:57,440 --> 01:24:01,570
you were stealing samples
and selling them. Is that right?

1140
01:24:05,910 --> 01:24:07,750
Let me get this straight.

1141
01:24:08,410 --> 01:24:12,460
We give you a high salary
with awards and benefits and trips,

1142
01:24:13,210 --> 01:24:16,460
and you decide to thank us
by taking even more for yourself?

1143
01:24:18,010 --> 01:24:20,100
Do you realize
we could have you prosecuted for this?

1144
01:24:20,180 --> 01:24:21,270
Tom.

1145
01:24:34,980 --> 01:24:36,780
Why would you bring this in now?

1146
01:24:39,490 --> 01:24:43,620
Because I needed to confess what I've done
and ask for your forgiveness.

1147
01:24:44,280 --> 01:24:45,880
Forgiveness?

1148
01:24:47,080 --> 01:24:49,580
I mean, how long have you been doing this?

1149
01:24:49,660 --> 01:24:51,170
How much money did you make?

1150
01:24:52,330 --> 01:24:53,460
About $19,000.

1151
01:24:54,040 --> 01:24:55,170
19,000?

1152
01:24:56,340 --> 01:24:58,090
- Is that all? Really?
- Tom.

1153
01:25:06,310 --> 01:25:07,930
Tony, it doesn't make sense
that you would do this

1154
01:25:08,020 --> 01:25:09,940
after you've already been terminated.

1155
01:25:11,640 --> 01:25:12,940
I realize that.

1156
01:25:14,020 --> 01:25:17,070
But I've gotten right with my family.
I've gotten right with God.

1157
01:25:18,190 --> 01:25:19,910
But I need to get right with you.

1158
01:25:21,530 --> 01:25:24,030
So I'm ready to accept
whatever decision you make.

1159
01:25:26,030 --> 01:25:27,580
Including arrest?

1160
01:25:29,240 --> 01:25:30,590
Whatever the consequence.

1161
01:25:30,750 --> 01:25:31,790
Oh.

1162
01:25:32,580 --> 01:25:34,050
That makes it easier for us.

1163
01:25:34,120 --> 01:25:36,190
Coleman, it's time to
call the authorities.

1164
01:25:36,210 --> 01:25:36,820
Not yet.

1165
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:40,800
Tony, are you willing to sign a statement?

1166
01:25:42,300 --> 01:25:43,390
I am.

1167
01:25:44,180 --> 01:25:45,850
Then I want two days to think about it.

1168
01:25:46,180 --> 01:25:47,650
- Two days?
- Yes.

1169
01:25:50,270 --> 01:25:51,730
You'll hear from me by then.

1170
01:25:53,230 --> 01:25:54,270
Thank you.

1171
01:26:04,360 --> 01:26:07,120
Hey, girls. Why don't you go inside
and grab something cold to drink?

1172
01:26:07,200 --> 01:26:08,540
Okay? We can start back in a little bit.

1173
01:26:08,620 --> 01:26:10,580
- Okay. Thanks, Ms. Jordan.
- All right.

1174
01:26:11,540 --> 01:26:12,880
Hey. Hey.

1175
01:26:15,870 --> 01:26:17,050
Well?

1176
01:26:18,790 --> 01:26:20,090
I don't know.

1177
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,630
I mean, Tom just wanted
to throw me in jail.

1178
01:26:25,010 --> 01:26:27,090
But Coleman says he wants two days
to think about it.

1179
01:26:28,050 --> 01:26:30,850
- Really? Did he seem angry?
- I couldn't tell.

1180
01:26:33,930 --> 01:26:36,060
Liz, this was the most awkward thing
I've ever done.

1181
01:26:36,140 --> 01:26:37,490
Yeah, but you did it.

1182
01:26:37,980 --> 01:26:40,110
Listen, you did the right thing.

1183
01:26:41,400 --> 01:26:43,120
Now we just have to pray and wait.

1184
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:48,410
Hey, why don't you go change?
Just come practice with your daughter.

1185
01:26:48,490 --> 01:26:50,790
Liz, why should I practice for a
competition when I might be in jail?

1186
01:26:50,870 --> 01:26:52,620
You don't know that.

1187
01:26:53,660 --> 01:26:55,960
Whatever happens, we trust God, right?

1188
01:26:57,670 --> 01:26:58,760
Right.

1189
01:27:03,630 --> 01:27:05,680
This is crazy. You know that, right?

1190
01:27:15,730 --> 01:27:20,730
<i>But it's gonna take.</i>

1191
01:27:20,810 --> 01:27:25,490
<i>Crazy faith.</i>

1192
01:27:25,570 --> 01:27:30,830
<i>So what if it costs everything.</i>

1193
01:27:31,120 --> 01:27:35,790
<i>I'm stepping out
I'm taking the leap.</i>

1194
01:27:35,910 --> 01:27:40,920
<i>And it's gonna take.</i>

1195
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:45,760
<i>Crazy faith.</i>

1196
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:51,020
<i>So what if it costs me everything.</i>

1197
01:27:51,090 --> 01:27:53,270
<i>I'm stepping out.</i>

1198
01:27:53,350 --> 01:27:58,900
<i>I'm taking the leap of crazy faith.</i>

1199
01:28:01,690 --> 01:28:04,110
<i>Crazy faith.</i>

1200
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:16,290
You're nervous.

1201
01:28:18,250 --> 01:28:19,790
Trying not to think about it.

1202
01:28:20,250 --> 01:28:21,920
What time are you supposed to be there?

1203
01:28:23,670 --> 01:28:24,790
9200.

1204
01:28:38,140 --> 01:28:40,060
- Coleman?
- Hello, Tony.

1205
01:28:40,940 --> 01:28:43,160
- Hi, Elizabeth.
- Hi, Coleman. How are you?

1206
01:28:43,400 --> 01:28:44,610
I'm fine, thank you.

1207
01:28:44,690 --> 01:28:48,740
I know this is unexpected, but I wondered
if you might give me a few minutes to talk.

1208
01:28:49,400 --> 01:28:51,910
- Yeah, sure. Come on in.
- Thank you.

1209
01:28:58,500 --> 01:29:00,920
Tony, I've been thinking about your visit.

1210
01:29:02,250 --> 01:29:05,420
It's probably all I've thought about
the past two days.

1211
01:29:06,420 --> 01:29:08,090
What you did was wrong.

1212
01:29:09,090 --> 01:29:10,760
And I was disappointed.

1213
01:29:12,380 --> 01:29:17,480
But we've fired salesmen before,
and well, life goes on.

1214
01:29:20,060 --> 01:29:22,060
But then you showed back up.

1215
01:29:24,520 --> 01:29:28,620
And, Tony, I've never seen anybody do
what you did.

1216
01:29:31,360 --> 01:29:35,040
I've never seen a man take total
responsibility for his wrongdoing,

1217
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:36,960
no matter the consequence.

1218
01:29:38,910 --> 01:29:40,830
And I kept asking myself, why?

1219
01:29:41,910 --> 01:29:43,460
Why would you do that?

1220
01:29:45,790 --> 01:29:47,640
The only answer I can come up with

1221
01:29:48,750 --> 01:29:51,430
is that you were sincere
in your desire to make it right,

1222
01:29:52,130 --> 01:29:54,260
and that you regret what you've done.

1223
01:29:55,510 --> 01:29:57,480
So I've chosen to believe you.

1224
01:29:59,640 --> 01:30:01,480
I can't give you your job back,

1225
01:30:04,390 --> 01:30:06,490
but I've decided not to prosecute.

1226
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:19,660
I do think it would be appropriate
to return the $19,000 back to the company.

1227
01:30:22,450 --> 01:30:26,250
- Yeah, we've already decided to do that.
- Very good.

1228
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:30,000
Well, if you'll sign an agreement
to that effect,

1229
01:30:30,710 --> 01:30:32,590
I think we should all move on.

1230
01:30:33,880 --> 01:30:38,850
So if you don't mind me seeing myself out,
I'll give you your evening back.

1231
01:30:43,850 --> 01:30:45,520
- Thank you, Tony.
- Thank you.

1232
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:47,280
- Elizabeth.
- Thank you.

1233
01:31:06,710 --> 01:31:08,710
Tony, that was grace!

1234
01:31:13,210 --> 01:31:15,890
That was God's grace toward us.

1235
01:31:22,680 --> 01:31:24,230
Thank you, Jesus.

1236
01:31:55,420 --> 01:31:58,180
<i>I just love these old houses.
They have so much character.</i>

1237
01:31:58,220 --> 01:31:59,380
<i>Oh, yeah. I agree.</i>

1238
01:31:59,430 --> 01:32:05,020
Well, the master bath was updated recently,
but she kept the original tub.

1239
01:32:05,100 --> 01:32:07,440
And all the tiles are brand new.

1240
01:32:07,520 --> 01:32:11,440
And, you know, I think this is best of all,
the floor is original hardwoods.

1241
01:32:12,230 --> 01:32:15,030
- I love hardwood floors.
- And you know what I found?

1242
01:32:15,110 --> 01:32:17,450
The neighborhood is so great
because it's established.

1243
01:32:17,530 --> 01:32:21,660
And quiet, you know? It seems mature.
How long have you guys been in ministry?

1244
01:32:21,990 --> 01:32:24,240
Uh, Charles pastored
the same church

1245
01:32:24,330 --> 01:32:26,170
- for 35 years.
- Wow.

1246
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:29,790
But, you know, we loved it,
but we knew it was time for a change,

1247
01:32:29,870 --> 01:32:33,720
and we wanted to be near our kids
and grand kids to help mentor them.

1248
01:32:34,460 --> 01:32:38,010
Charles, what are you doing?

1249
01:32:40,550 --> 01:32:42,470
Someone's been praying in this closet.

1250
01:32:43,340 --> 01:32:46,640
That's right. That was her prayer closet.
How did you know that?

1251
01:32:48,390 --> 01:32:51,140
It's almost like it's baked in.

1252
01:32:57,150 --> 01:32:59,650
Ma'am, we'll take the house.

1253
01:33:09,500 --> 01:33:11,750
Well, hello. Come on in.
You must be Elizabeth.

1254
01:33:11,830 --> 01:33:14,800
- Yes, thank you.
- Hey, there, young lady.

1255
01:33:15,750 --> 01:33:19,470
- You're C.W. Williams, the city manager.
- I am.

1256
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:22,220
- You're Clyde?
- I'm Clyde.

1257
01:33:22,300 --> 01:33:25,770
- You got to be kidding me.
- Hey, Elizabeth!

1258
01:33:25,850 --> 01:33:28,440
- Hey, Danielle!
- Nice to meet you.

1259
01:33:28,520 --> 01:33:29,940
I'll let you all catch up.

1260
01:33:30,890 --> 01:33:33,820
You never told me that your son
was the city manager!

1261
01:33:33,900 --> 01:33:37,070
I didn't? My son's the city manager.

1262
01:33:37,270 --> 01:33:40,280
Okay.
I got some good news for you.

1263
01:33:40,440 --> 01:33:43,200
I bet you gonna tell me

1264
01:33:44,160 --> 01:33:49,710
that a retired pastor from Texas
and his wife wanna buy my house.

1265
01:33:50,080 --> 01:33:51,330
Now see,

1266
01:33:51,870 --> 01:33:53,950
see, that's the kind of relationship
with God I want.

1267
01:33:53,960 --> 01:33:56,300
I want Him speaking to me like that.
What did He say?

1268
01:33:56,380 --> 01:33:58,170
Well, it was actually your daughter.

1269
01:33:58,250 --> 01:34:01,550
She texted me on my new smart phone
on the way over here.

1270
01:34:03,470 --> 01:34:06,310
Don't be mad, Mom!
I hardly get to text anybody!

1271
01:34:06,390 --> 01:34:08,390
And this thing is so handy.

1272
01:34:08,470 --> 01:34:11,730
I've already downloaded
a couple prayer apps,

1273
01:34:11,810 --> 01:34:14,110
and got a couple gospel songs.

1274
01:34:18,900 --> 01:34:19,990
All right, guys.

1275
01:34:20,070 --> 01:34:22,620
Wanna take these popsicles outside,
eat them on the back porch?

1276
01:34:22,690 --> 01:34:26,950
Here we go. Two hot cups of coffee.

1277
01:34:27,950 --> 01:34:29,950
Well, if it's hot, then I'll drink it.

1278
01:34:33,750 --> 01:34:36,270
Now, we're still gonna get together
for our little chats, right?

1279
01:34:36,290 --> 01:34:37,420
Oh, yes!

1280
01:34:37,500 --> 01:34:41,180
- But now it can't just be the both of us.
- What do you mean?

1281
01:34:41,250 --> 01:34:45,930
Oh, you need to find a young woman
to invest in, and I'll do the same.

1282
01:34:46,630 --> 01:34:49,390
We all need help every now and then.

1283
01:34:49,720 --> 01:34:54,570
Ms. Clara, I really can't tell you
how much your friendship means to me.

1284
01:34:54,640 --> 01:34:56,610
Oh, that goes for the both of us.

1285
01:34:56,690 --> 01:35:00,820
No, really. I wasn't willing to admit
how much help I needed.

1286
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:04,240
And I needed somebody to wake me up

1287
01:35:04,320 --> 01:35:07,740
from the insanity of doing
the same thing over and over.

1288
01:35:08,450 --> 01:35:10,450
You've been a gift from God to me.

1289
01:35:10,950 --> 01:35:13,700
Don't you think that
this has been one-sided.

1290
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:18,000
This has meant more to me than you know.

1291
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:19,170
Well, good.

1292
01:35:20,460 --> 01:35:23,760
I can't imagine how much your prayers
and your passion for God

1293
01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:25,220
must have meant to your husband.

1294
01:35:25,300 --> 01:35:27,140
Gosh, I wish I could've met him.

1295
01:35:28,340 --> 01:35:29,560
No.

1296
01:35:30,300 --> 01:35:31,650
No, you don't.

1297
01:35:32,600 --> 01:35:35,100
See, I wasn't the same woman back then.

1298
01:35:36,310 --> 01:35:40,060
When Leo died, we were not on good terms.

1299
01:35:41,230 --> 01:35:47,330
I always felt pushed to the back burner while
the military took first place in his life.

1300
01:35:48,030 --> 01:35:52,580
And I was... I was bitter, Elizabeth.
I was so bitter.

1301
01:35:53,790 --> 01:35:57,630
But even then,
God was showing me what to do.

1302
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:04,800
He was prompting me to fight for Leo,
to pray for Leo, and I refused.

1303
01:36:05,710 --> 01:36:10,180
And I kept pushing it back
and pushing it back until it was too late.

1304
01:36:11,970 --> 01:36:18,820
And there's no grief as great
as denying the truth until it's too late.

1305
01:36:20,270 --> 01:36:22,320
It was my selfish pride, Elizabeth.

1306
01:36:24,730 --> 01:36:26,700
Oh, my selfish pride!

1307
01:36:29,780 --> 01:36:31,830
And I confessed it.

1308
01:36:33,240 --> 01:36:37,840
And I repented,
and I begged God to forgive me.

1309
01:36:39,250 --> 01:36:41,300
But I still have a scar.

1310
01:36:43,630 --> 01:36:47,350
And then I started spending more time
with the Lord,

1311
01:36:47,880 --> 01:36:49,550
and in His word.

1312
01:36:51,220 --> 01:36:53,850
And I learned how to fight

1313
01:36:54,890 --> 01:36:56,480
in prayer first.

1314
01:37:00,520 --> 01:37:02,110
I'm an old woman now.

1315
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:09,080
And I realized that I have not passed on
what I had learned.

1316
01:37:11,450 --> 01:37:14,200
And when I last visited Leo's grave,

1317
01:37:15,330 --> 01:37:18,420
<i>I asked God to send me someone
that I could help.</i>

1318
01:37:19,660 --> 01:37:23,040
<i>Someone that I could teach to fight
the right way.</i>

1319
01:37:25,210 --> 01:37:28,460
And He sent me Elizabeth Jordan.

1320
01:37:32,470 --> 01:37:35,190
So you see, you...

1321
01:37:39,720 --> 01:37:42,100
You were the answer to my prayer.

1322
01:37:44,650 --> 01:37:50,950
Well, now you've got to teach other people
to seek the Lord.

1323
01:37:51,900 --> 01:37:55,280
You've got to teach other young wives
how to fight.

1324
01:37:56,530 --> 01:37:58,660
Yeah. I will.

1325
01:38:00,450 --> 01:38:01,630
I will.

1326
01:38:10,130 --> 01:38:13,430
- Mom, did you bring my snack?
- Oh, yeah, baby, I got it right here.

1327
01:38:13,510 --> 01:38:16,310
- Hey, Danielle, are you nervous?
- Very.

1328
01:38:16,970 --> 01:38:19,140
- Are you nervous?
- Oh, yeah!

1329
01:38:19,640 --> 01:38:22,360
But I'll be fine just as long as
I don't fall on my face.

1330
01:38:22,430 --> 01:38:24,060
Are you still gonna do that flip?

1331
01:38:24,140 --> 01:38:26,610
Yeah, I'm gonna do the flip.
And that's not all.

1332
01:38:26,690 --> 01:38:28,740
Huh, Danielle?

1333
01:38:28,820 --> 01:38:30,240
You ain't seen nothing yet, Liz.

1334
01:38:30,320 --> 01:38:32,660
Now I'm nervous.

1335
01:38:35,410 --> 01:38:36,950
Tony, isn't that Tom?

1336
01:38:39,660 --> 01:38:41,040
Yeah, it is.

1337
01:38:41,990 --> 01:38:43,370
Looks like a flat.

1338
01:38:44,160 --> 01:38:47,210
No. No! No. No, I can't wait that long!

1339
01:38:47,830 --> 01:38:51,810
Why do you promote helping out
in 30 minutes when it takes 45 to get here?

1340
01:38:53,420 --> 01:38:55,300
Listen, you guys stay put.

1341
01:38:55,380 --> 01:38:58,100
You know, I don't care. Just send someone!

1342
01:39:57,780 --> 01:39:59,530
Why did you do that?

1343
01:40:00,450 --> 01:40:03,040
'Cause that's how
I wanna be treated, Danielle.

1344
01:40:22,680 --> 01:40:23,770
Wow!

1345
01:40:25,180 --> 01:40:27,230
I'm so proud of you
for everything that you've done.

1346
01:40:27,310 --> 01:40:29,810
And I just can't wait to see
what you guys do out there.

1347
01:40:29,890 --> 01:40:31,320
- You wanna say something to them?
- Yeah, yeah.

1348
01:40:31,400 --> 01:40:31,960
Okay, good.

1349
01:40:31,980 --> 01:40:34,220
Listen, I just spoke
with the judges. Okay?

1350
01:40:34,270 --> 01:40:36,210
They've agreed to let us go last.
All right?

1351
01:40:36,240 --> 01:40:36,740
Yes!

1352
01:40:36,780 --> 01:40:39,400
Remember what we talked about?
We'll be the last thing they see.

1353
01:40:39,490 --> 01:40:42,740
We'll be impressive. All right?
Listen, I know you guys are nervous.

1354
01:40:42,820 --> 01:40:44,140
Believe me, lam, too.

1355
01:40:44,200 --> 01:40:47,550
But we're gonna take that nervous energy
and we're gonna turn it into rocket fuel.

1356
01:40:47,620 --> 01:40:48,870
- All right? You guys are with me?
- Yeah.

1357
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:50,050
All right, let's blow them away.

1358
01:40:50,120 --> 01:40:52,840
Here we go. Comets on three.
All right, one, two, three.

1359
01:40:52,920 --> 01:40:54,170
Comets!

1360
01:40:56,460 --> 01:40:58,720
<i>Welcome to the
Double Dutch Citywide Championship.</i>

1361
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:00,550
<i>Who's ready for an awesome day?</i>

1362
01:41:03,840 --> 01:41:07,640
<i>All right. We're getting started right now
with the speed round. Here we go!</i>

1363
01:41:23,320 --> 01:41:26,170
<i>Raindrops rollin' off my brim.</i>

1364
01:41:26,740 --> 01:41:30,290
<i>Streetlights got the pavement glistenin'.</i>

1365
01:41:30,580 --> 01:41:35,340
<i>Touchdown, I fall into Your arms
Right where I belong.</i>

1366
01:41:35,420 --> 01:41:37,260
<i>Your everlasting arms...</i>

1367
01:41:37,340 --> 01:41:40,510
<i>All right, so the speed scores
will be added to the freestyle scores.</i>

1368
01:41:40,590 --> 01:41:42,840
<i>So let's start the freestyle competition.</i>

1369
01:41:42,930 --> 01:41:44,770
<i>First up is the Moon Jumpers.</i>

1370
01:41:45,640 --> 01:41:49,310
<i>And where would I be without You.</i>

1371
01:41:51,430 --> 01:41:53,940
<i>I'd be packin' my bags...</i>

1372
01:41:54,020 --> 01:41:56,270
<i>Next up is the Mustangs!</i>

1373
01:41:56,360 --> 01:41:58,820
<i>Chasin' every breeze that blows my way.</i>

1374
01:41:58,900 --> 01:42:03,580
<i>I'd be building my kingdom
just to watch it fade away.</i>

1375
01:42:06,410 --> 01:42:10,040
<i>I'd be packin' my bags
when I need to stay...</i>

1376
01:42:10,490 --> 01:42:12,960
<i>Now let's give it up
for the Tigers!</i>

1377
01:42:13,710 --> 01:42:18,760
<i>I'd be building my kingdom
just to watch it fade away.</i>

1378
01:42:19,500 --> 01:42:22,300
<i>It's true
That's me without You...</i>

1379
01:42:26,260 --> 01:42:28,510
<i>Here come the SkipSations!</i>

1380
01:42:28,600 --> 01:42:31,100
<i>That's me without You.</i>

1381
01:42:35,390 --> 01:42:36,520
<i>That's me.</i>

1382
01:42:42,820 --> 01:42:45,070
<i>That's me without You...</i>

1383
01:42:45,570 --> 01:42:47,740
<i>Now for the Speed Angels!</i>

1384
01:42:51,660 --> 01:42:54,760
<i>Flashback, step into the scene.</i>

1385
01:42:55,410 --> 01:42:59,140
<i>There's You and there's
a very different me.</i>

1386
01:42:59,210 --> 01:43:02,010
<i>Touchdown, You had me at believe.</i>

1387
01:43:02,090 --> 01:43:04,640
<i>You had me at believe, You did...</i>

1388
01:43:06,880 --> 01:43:08,930
<i>And where would I be.</i>

1389
01:43:09,010 --> 01:43:11,560
<i>Let's hear it
for the Super Skippers!</i>

1390
01:43:11,640 --> 01:43:12,640
<i>Without You.</i>

1391
01:43:13,060 --> 01:43:16,530
<i>I'd be packin' my
bags when I need to stay.</i>

1392
01:43:16,600 --> 01:43:20,110
<i>I'd be chasin' every
breeze that blows my way.</i>

1393
01:43:20,940 --> 01:43:25,490
<i>I'd be building my kingdom
just to watch it fade away.</i>

1394
01:43:25,950 --> 01:43:27,040
<i>It's true.</i>

1395
01:43:27,110 --> 01:43:29,290
<i>That's me without You.</i>

1396
01:43:30,700 --> 01:43:33,800
<i>That's me without You.</i>

1397
01:43:34,580 --> 01:43:37,960
<i>That's me without You.</i>

1398
01:43:38,290 --> 01:43:40,960
<i>And now for the final team
in our freestyle competition.</i>

1399
01:43:41,040 --> 01:43:42,970
<i>Let's hear it for the Comets!</i>

1400
01:44:04,110 --> 01:44:06,530
<i>There is no such, no such thing.</i>

1401
01:44:06,940 --> 01:44:09,740
<i>There is no such, no such thing.</i>

1402
01:44:10,410 --> 01:44:15,500
<i>There is no such, no such thing
as impossible.</i>

1403
01:44:16,040 --> 01:44:18,960
<i>We can rise above the typical.</i>

1404
01:44:19,210 --> 01:44:22,300
<i>And be anything but usual.</i>

1405
01:44:22,500 --> 01:44:25,600
<i>We know, we know, we know.</i>

1406
01:44:25,920 --> 01:44:29,270
<i>That there's no such thing as impossible.</i>

1407
01:44:29,550 --> 01:44:32,520
<i>And nothing is unreachable.</i>

1408
01:44:32,600 --> 01:44:35,940
<i>When we trust the God of miracles.</i>

1409
01:44:36,100 --> 01:44:39,070
<i>We know, we know, we know.</i>

1410
01:44:39,520 --> 01:44:43,020
<i>That there's no such thing as impossible.</i>

1411
01:44:57,540 --> 01:45:00,340
That's my dad! That's my dad!

1412
01:45:07,460 --> 01:45:08,680
<i>The judges' scores are in.</i>

1413
01:45:08,760 --> 01:45:12,140
<i>In third place this year,
let's hear it for the Super Skippers!</i>

1414
01:45:19,850 --> 01:45:23,780
<i>And in second place, it was so close!
Let's hear it for the Comets!</i>

1415
01:45:37,700 --> 01:45:41,250
<i>And now our Double Dutch
Citywide Champions for this year,</i>

1416
01:45:41,330 --> 01:45:43,830
<i>let's hear it for the Speed Angels!</i>

1417
01:45:58,310 --> 01:45:59,980
Hey, what are you doing?

1418
01:46:00,060 --> 01:46:02,810
- Hey, hey.
- What's going on?

1419
01:46:05,520 --> 01:46:08,320
I'll tell you in a minute, okay?
How was dinner?

1420
01:46:08,400 --> 01:46:09,700
Oh, it was good.

1421
01:46:09,780 --> 01:46:12,100
Cynthia actually agreed to meet with me
on a regular basis.

1422
01:46:12,110 --> 01:46:13,200
Good. Good.

1423
01:46:13,280 --> 01:46:15,580
- We'll try Tuesday afternoons to start.
- Okay.

1424
01:46:15,700 --> 01:46:18,750
Now listen, did they, uh, forgive me
for not helping them out?

1425
01:46:18,830 --> 01:46:20,620
Oh, yeah. I think so.

1426
01:46:21,330 --> 01:46:24,250
You know, they really appreciated
the $500 we gave them though.

1427
01:46:24,330 --> 01:46:27,430
I told her we really wanted to do more
but we just couldn't right now

1428
01:46:27,500 --> 01:46:29,260
- the way things are tight with money.
- Hmm.

1429
01:46:29,340 --> 01:46:31,890
She understood. But we did skip dessert.

1430
01:46:32,260 --> 01:46:33,600
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1431
01:46:34,840 --> 01:46:37,470
Well, listen, I got something
I need to tell you. Okay?

1432
01:46:37,550 --> 01:46:40,150
Now I want you to think about it
before you respond, okay?

1433
01:46:40,220 --> 01:46:41,520
What is it?

1434
01:46:42,730 --> 01:46:46,530
I had an interview today.
And I got offered the job on the spot.

1435
01:46:47,060 --> 01:46:48,280
To do what?

1436
01:46:49,980 --> 01:46:52,490
To be the new director
at the community center.

1437
01:46:53,740 --> 01:46:55,990
Liz, we know this place so well. You know?

1438
01:46:57,240 --> 01:47:00,120
I'm telling you, I can do this job.

1439
01:47:00,490 --> 01:47:03,090
Gosh. You would be closer to home.

1440
01:47:04,120 --> 01:47:08,340
It's only half the pay,
but if we're wise, I know we can make it.

1441
01:47:11,050 --> 01:47:12,470
Listen to me.

1442
01:47:13,590 --> 01:47:17,810
I would rather have a man chasing Jesus
than a house full of stuff.

1443
01:47:20,300 --> 01:47:21,400
Okay.

1444
01:47:22,390 --> 01:47:24,110
All right, then I'll accept it.

1445
01:47:26,020 --> 01:47:28,740
You know what, I'm kind of glad
you didn't have that dessert tonight.

1446
01:47:28,770 --> 01:47:29,940
Why?

1447
01:47:30,020 --> 01:47:34,030
I got something for you.
Why don't you have a seat on the couch?

1448
01:47:34,320 --> 01:47:36,290
- What?
- Just head to the couch.

1449
01:47:36,360 --> 01:47:38,210
I got this, don't worry about it.

1450
01:47:42,870 --> 01:47:44,090
Where's Danielle?

1451
01:47:44,200 --> 01:47:48,420
She's fine. She's over at Jennifer's house.
They're having a sleepover. Yeah.

1452
01:47:48,500 --> 01:47:49,920
What is this?

1453
01:47:51,090 --> 01:47:52,300
You'll see.

1454
01:47:52,670 --> 01:47:55,140
No, no, no. Tony, don't touch my feet.

1455
01:47:55,210 --> 01:47:58,640
Hey. Just roll with it. Okay?
All right, come on now.

1456
01:48:09,560 --> 01:48:11,610
Oh, my goodness, it feels so good.

1457
01:48:14,070 --> 01:48:16,540
Now it's time I give you what you deserve.

1458
01:48:17,950 --> 01:48:21,920
This is for the woman I don't deserve.

1459
01:48:27,910 --> 01:48:30,010
You go ahead and work on that,

1460
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:34,590
and I am gonna get started on that
foot massage you've been asking for.

1461
01:48:35,670 --> 01:48:37,170
Really?

1462
01:48:38,380 --> 01:48:41,260
- Are you really doing this for me?
- Yeah, come on now.

1463
01:48:42,760 --> 01:48:45,860
No, no, no, Tony!
I don't want you to smell my feet.

1464
01:48:45,930 --> 01:48:50,360
Babe, look. I told you, I got this.
You... Look.

1465
01:48:51,900 --> 01:48:55,820
You need to trust me, okay? So, like that.

1466
01:48:58,780 --> 01:49:01,030
I'm ready to go. You hear me?

1467
01:49:01,110 --> 01:49:02,790
- You're terrible.
- Yeah.

1468
01:49:06,870 --> 01:49:07,960
What's wrong?

1469
01:49:08,580 --> 01:49:10,630
I'm eating my favorite dessert

1470
01:49:12,620 --> 01:49:15,300
while my husband is rubbing my feet.

1471
01:49:20,260 --> 01:49:22,810
There has got to be a God in Heaven!

1472
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:06,550
You've done it again, Lord.

1473
01:50:07,600 --> 01:50:09,140
You've done it again.

1474
01:50:11,680 --> 01:50:16,940
You are good and You are mighty
and You are merciful!

1475
01:50:18,860 --> 01:50:23,280
And You keep taking care of me
when I don't deserve it.

1476
01:50:23,360 --> 01:50:25,410
Praise You, Jesus!

1477
01:50:26,320 --> 01:50:28,450
You are Lord.

1478
01:50:32,330 --> 01:50:34,250
Give me another one, Lord.

1479
01:50:35,540 --> 01:50:39,170
Guide me to who You want me to help.

1480
01:50:40,550 --> 01:50:44,140
Raise up more that will
call upon Your name!

1481
01:50:45,050 --> 01:50:49,850
<i>Raise up those that love You
and seek You and trust You!</i>

1482
01:50:49,930 --> 01:50:52,730
<i>Raise them up, Lord! Raise them up!</i>

1483
01:50:53,810 --> 01:51:00,070
<i>Lord, we need a generation of believers
who are not ashamed of the gospel.</i>

1484
01:51:00,900 --> 01:51:04,070
<i>We need an army of believers, Lord,</i>

1485
01:51:05,070 --> 01:51:07,450
<i>that hate to be lukewarm</i>

1486
01:51:08,240 --> 01:51:11,960
<i>and will stand on
Your word above all else.</i>

1487
01:51:12,040 --> 01:51:14,960
<i>Raise them up, Lord. Raise them up.</i>

1488
01:51:16,500 --> 01:51:20,090
<i>I pray for unity among
those that love You.</i>

1489
01:51:21,210 --> 01:51:26,430
<i>I pray that You open their eyes
so that they can see Your truth, Lord.</i>

1490
01:51:27,180 --> 01:51:31,980
<i>I pray for Your hand
of protection and guidance!</i>

1491
01:51:33,930 --> 01:51:39,360
<i>Raise up a generation, Lord,
that will take light into this world.</i>

1492
01:51:39,980 --> 01:51:43,360
<i>That will not compromise
when under pressure!</i>

1493
01:51:43,440 --> 01:51:47,950
<i>That will not cower, Lord,
when others fall away!</i>

1494
01:51:48,990 --> 01:51:52,990
<i>Raise them up, Lord,
that they will proclaim</i>

1495
01:51:53,080 --> 01:51:57,880
<i>that there is salvation
in the name of Jesus Christ!</i>

1496
01:51:58,170 --> 01:52:02,670
<i>Raise up warriors, Lord,
who will fight on their knees,</i>

1497
01:52:03,130 --> 01:52:06,630
<i>who will worship You
with their whole hearts, Lord.</i>

1498
01:52:07,090 --> 01:52:09,760
Lord, call us to battle,

1499
01:52:10,050 --> 01:52:15,650
<i>that we may proclaim You
King of Kings and Lord of Lords!</i>

1500
01:52:16,850 --> 01:52:20,350
I pray these things with all my heart!

1501
01:52:21,980 --> 01:52:25,030
Raise them up, Lord! Raise them up!

1502
01:54:52,260 --> 01:54:56,730
<i>I see the smoke on the horizon.</i>

1503
01:54:56,800 --> 01:55:00,400
<i>I feel my heart pounding in my chest.</i>

1504
01:55:01,060 --> 01:55:05,110
<i>I hear the war raging all around me.</i>

1505
01:55:05,190 --> 01:55:09,410
<i>But somehow I feel like
I was born for this.</i>

1506
01:55:09,770 --> 01:55:14,030
<i>I can taste or fee! The ageless courage.</i>

1507
01:55:14,150 --> 01:55:20,030
<i>As I raise my shield and lift my sword.</i>

1508
01:55:20,240 --> 01:55:25,040
<i>And I fall on my knees
and I fight like a warrior.</i>

1509
01:55:25,160 --> 01:55:28,920
<i>I am a warrior on my knees.</i>

1510
01:55:29,040 --> 01:55:33,800
<i>I call on the Name of the One
Who is Conqueror.</i>

1511
01:55:33,880 --> 01:55:37,350
<i>I'm only a conqueror when I believe.</i>

1512
01:55:37,840 --> 01:55:42,100
<i>The enemy trembles every time.</i>

1513
01:55:42,260 --> 01:55:46,310
<i>Because he knows the battle
is no longer mine.</i>

1514
01:55:46,390 --> 01:55:51,320
<i>When I fall on my knees
and I fight like a warrior.</i>

1515
01:55:51,520 --> 01:55:55,030
<i>Like a warrior, oh.</i>

1516
01:55:55,610 --> 01:55:59,830
<i>Daughters and sons
we can hear your calling.</i>

1517
01:56:00,030 --> 01:56:03,750
<i>Broken and weak, we can hear your cry.</i>

1518
01:56:04,040 --> 01:56:08,420
<i>And even though our enemy
roars like a lion.</i>

1519
01:56:08,500 --> 01:56:12,420
<i>The Lion of Judah is on our side.</i>

1520
01:56:12,840 --> 01:56:17,180
<i>And He will go before us and behind us.</i>

1521
01:56:17,380 --> 01:56:23,060
<i>Fighting on the left and on the right.</i>

1522
01:56:23,220 --> 01:56:28,190
<i>So I fall on my knees and
I fight like a warrior.</i>

1523
01:56:28,270 --> 01:56:32,110
<i>I am a warrior on my knees.</i>

1524
01:56:32,190 --> 01:56:36,790
<i>When I call on the Name of the One
Who is Conqueror.</i>

1525
01:56:36,860 --> 01:56:40,960
<i>I'm more than a conqueror when I believe.</i>

1526
01:56:41,200 --> 01:56:45,250
<i>The enemy trembles every time.</i>

1527
01:56:45,330 --> 01:56:49,550
<i>Because he knows the battle
is no longer mine.</i>

1528
01:56:49,620 --> 01:56:54,600
<i>But I fall on my knees
and I fight like a warrior.</i>

1529
01:56:54,710 --> 01:56:56,760
<i>Like a warrior.</i>

1530
01:56:56,880 --> 01:57:00,930
<i>Like a warrior.</i>

1531
01:57:07,310 --> 01:57:11,440
<i>Our weapons are trust
Our weapons are hope.</i>

1532
01:57:11,560 --> 01:57:15,940
<i>In the King of Kings
and the Lord of Lords.</i>

1533
01:57:16,020 --> 01:57:20,030
<i>"He says," I am with
you so don't be afraid.</i>

1534
01:57:20,490 --> 01:57:26,540
<i>"Because I have already won this war."</i>

1535
01:57:27,790 --> 01:57:31,760
<i>"So fall on your knees and fight with Me."</i>

1536
01:57:32,460 --> 01:57:37,630
<i>We are the warriors
when we are on our knees.</i>

1537
01:57:38,050 --> 01:57:40,050
<i>The enemy trembles.</i>

1538
01:57:40,130 --> 01:57:44,640
<i>We will fall on our knees
and fight like a warrior.</i>

1539
01:57:44,800 --> 01:57:48,560
