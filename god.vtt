00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.085
<font face="Comic Sans MS"> Oh, I love to hear
the song of creation </font>

2
00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.687
<font face="Comic Sans MS"> The wind and the rhythm
of the rain </font>

3
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.771
<font face="Comic Sans MS"> Oh, the thunder,
it speaks of your power </font>

4
00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:08.680
<font face="Comic Sans MS"> But there's something
in the sound of the saints </font>

5
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.771
<font face="Comic Sans MS"> I've been washed
in the roar of the ocean </font>

6
00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.407
<font face="Comic Sans MS"> Found peace in the echoes
of a cave </font>

7
00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.730
<font face="Comic Sans MS"> And the trees of the field,
they clap their hands </font>

8
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.162
<font face="Comic Sans MS"> But there's something
in the sound of the saints </font>

9
00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.285
<font face="Comic Sans MS"> From the lips
of those you saved </font>

10
00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.842
<font face="Comic Sans MS"> A redemption song will rise </font>

11
00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.602
<font face="Comic Sans MS"> With a sound so full
it cracks the sky </font>

12
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.486
<font face="Comic Sans MS"> Whoa, we sing hallelujah </font>

13
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.321
<font face="Comic Sans MS"> Whoa, we sing amen </font>

14
00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.240
<font face="Comic Sans MS"> Hear the sound of the saints
as we march onto Zion </font>

15
00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.251
<font face="Comic Sans MS"> Singing hallelujah, amen </font>

16
00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.490
<font face="Comic Sans MS"> Singing hallelujah,
amen </font>

17
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.130
<font face="Comic Sans MS"> I will hear the chorus
of the angels </font>

18
00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.245
<font face="Comic Sans MS"> A forever
symphony of praise </font>

19
00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.762
<font face="Comic Sans MS"> I long to hear
the voice of my Savior </font>

20
00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.601
<font face="Comic Sans MS"> And he hears us
the sound of the saints </font>

21
00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.566
<font face="Comic Sans MS"> From the lips
of those you saved </font>

22
00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.651
<font face="Comic Sans MS"> A redemption song will rise </font>

23
00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.651
<font face="Comic Sans MS"> Every tongue, every tribe
hear the church, your bride </font>

24
00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.003
<font face="Comic Sans MS"> Whoa, we sing hallelujah </font>

25
00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.248
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I'm running late, 0h.</font>

26
00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.522
<font face="Comic Sans MS"> Whoa, we sing amen </font>

27
00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.563
<font face="Comic Sans MS"> Hear the sound of the saints </font>

28
00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.409
<font face="Comic Sans MS"> As we march onto Zion </font>

29
00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.445
<font face="Comic Sans MS"> Singing hallelujah, amen </font>

30
00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:47.442
<font face="Comic Sans MS"> Singing hallelujah,
amen </font>

31
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:55.200
<font face="Comic Sans MS"> Whoa, whoa </font>

32
00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.442
<font face="Comic Sans MS"> Our hearts will rise </font>

33
00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.608
<font face="Comic Sans MS"> Our song shall be </font>

34
00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:06.922
<font face="Comic Sans MS"> Jesus Christ,
our Savior King forever </font>

35
00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.162
<font face="Comic Sans MS"> Our hearts will rise </font>

36
00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.964
<font face="Comic Sans MS"> The saints will sing </font>

37
00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.051
<font face="Comic Sans MS"> Of Jesus Christ,
our Savior King </font>

38
00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:23.170
<font face="Comic Sans MS"> Forever, forever </font>

39
00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.080
<font face="Comic Sans MS"> Whoa, we sing hallelujah </font>

40
00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.886
<font face="Comic Sans MS"> Whoa, we sing amen </font>

41
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.891
<font face="Comic Sans MS"> Hear the sound of the saints
as we march onto Zion </font>

42
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.085
<font face="Comic Sans MS"> Singing hallelujah, amen </font>

43
00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.491
<font face="Comic Sans MS"> Hallelujah, amen </font>

44
00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Brooke, we're all
upset, but we need to move on.</font>

45
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:46.840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Honey, you're a junior now.</font>

46
00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.371
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's your make-or-break year,</font>

47
00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so there's no room
for self pity.</font>

48
00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you give Marlene and I
a ride to school today?</font>

49
00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, honey,
I don't have time.</font>

50
00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have an 8:30 with Marc Shelley
at White & Wolfe.</font>

51
00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?! Richard,
you didn't say anything!</font>

52
00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How did you get the meeting?</font>

53
00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.368
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's just a meeting,
so don't get too excited.</font>

54
00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But it could be huge.</font>

55
00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know!</font>

56
00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:09.646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who's going to
the meeting with you?</font>

57
00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, I got the meeting.</font>

58
00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know, I just think maybe you
should take Melinda or Janice.</font>

59
00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Janice?
You want me to take Janice?</font>

60
00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.403
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah, why not?
- I'm not taking Janice.</font>

61
00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:21.046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Rough morning?
- You know my parents.</font>

62
00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.845
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe they just
need a little more time.</font>

63
00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know about that.</font>

64
00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd say they're
pretty over it.</font>

65
00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.411
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My mom's making
tacos tonight.</font>

66
00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll let her know
you're coming.</font>

67
00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not like they'll miss me.</font>

68
00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Brooke, I'm serious, honey.</font>

69
00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You need to get focused
or you could say,</font>

70
00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Good-bye Stanford,
hello Somewhere State."</font>

71
00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Got it.</font>

72
00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.091
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yikes.</font>

73
00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good morning!</font>

74
00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:53.966
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Morning, Grace.</font>

75
00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.162
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I keep telling you, you
don't have to keep doing this.</font>

76
00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:57.645
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you kidding?</font>

77
00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.649
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is the best
part of my day, Gramps.</font>

78
00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pills first.</font>

79
00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're a good girl.</font>

80
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah, honey, you know I'm not
gonna be around here forever,</font>

81
00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you might wanna start
thinking about some other guy</font>

82
00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:16.009
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you wanna have breakfast with.</font>

83
00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.804
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll work on that.</font>

84
00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay</font>

85
00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, I love the way
you do the oatmeal,</font>

86
00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.091
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but what do you say</font>

87
00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I take you out for bacon and
eggs this morning, my treat.</font>

88
00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not after your
last cholesterol test.</font>

89
00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Besides, I have some papers
I have to grade</font>

90
00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:33.721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">before the staff meeting.</font>

91
00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm 81 years old,</font>

92
00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and bacon is not gonna be
what kills me.</font>

93
00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:43.005
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nice try, you're 82.</font>

94
00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

95
00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good morning.</font>

96
00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:51.926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have a nice day.</font>

97
00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Morning, ladies.</font>

98
00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:54.766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Morning.</font>

99
00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good morning.</font>

100
00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, what do you call
a teacher with no students?</font>

101
00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Unemployed.</font>

102
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.728
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got it,
how about ecstatic?</font>

103
00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:10.081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're both right. Retired!</font>

104
00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Only 36 days to go!</font>

105
00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:13.720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know you're
gonna miss the kids</font>

106
00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when you're gone, Rizzo.</font>

107
00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, Grace.
That's sweet, but no, I won't.</font>

108
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.445
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The older I get,</font>

109
00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the more difficult
these kids are to deal with.</font>

110
00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I totally agree.</font>

111
00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:23.921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yesterday, I just about
snatched at Tim Webster.</font>

112
00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That boy had me
on my last nerve.</font>

113
00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:26.886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I happen to think
that difficult students</font>

114
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">can be a blessing.</font>

115
00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:33.402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Grace, honey, when is this
optimism ever gonna wear off?</font>

116
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bill. Bill.</font>

117
00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:41.485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bill.</font>

118
00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:46.571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Junk mail.</font>

119
00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, man!</font>

120
00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:52.204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">David,
why are you always so sad?</font>

121
00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:55.449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey! You're back!</font>

122
00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:56.931
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why are you back?</font>

123
00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:58.326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My pastor gave me permission</font>

124
00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to finish my doctorate
at Hadleigh,</font>

125
00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:05.565
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so if that's okay with you,
I'm gonna be here for awhile.</font>

126
00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:07.887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, David, you are a mess.</font>

127
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What happened to you?</font>

128
00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:11.408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I woke up.</font>

129
00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, for 500 points,</font>

130
00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:17.165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for all the cheese,
for the game.</font>

131
00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:20.124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This quote is from
what document?</font>

132
00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"We hold these truths
to be self-evident,</font>

133
00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:23.326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"that all men are created equal,</font>

134
00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"that they are endowed
by their Creator</font>

rights, that among these--"</font>

136
00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:28.927
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Boom, baby!</font>

137
00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:30.849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, Team 1,
what's your answer?</font>

138
00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:34.203
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our answer is
the Declaration of Independence.</font>

139
00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:36.721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's...correct!</font>

140
00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:38.251
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Team 1 wins!</font>

141
00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:40.681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes!</font>

142
00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:43.041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, you guys,</font>

143
00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Monday we will examine the
assertion of individual rights</font>

144
00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:46.605
<font face="Comic Sans MS">through the last century.</font>

145
00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:49.007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have a good weekend.</font>

146
00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:55.809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Brooke, are you okay?</font>

147
00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:58.287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm fine.</font>

148
00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:00.209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you sure?</font>

149
00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:03.051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, thanks.</font>

150
00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:20.927
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ms. Ryan?</font>

151
00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:43.806
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I lied.</font>

152
00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:48.165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you sure you're being fair?</font>

153
00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:50.521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Trust me, they're over it,</font>

154
00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:53.086
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and they expect me
to be over it, too.</font>

155
00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:56.443
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's like to them,
he never even existed.</font>

156
00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:58.130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The only thing
that I know for sure</font>

157
00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:01.847
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is that I'm never going
to see my brother again.</font>

158
00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:04.531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everybody's asked if there's
anything that they can do.</font>

159
00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:06.244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The truth is,
no one can do anything</font>

160
00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:07.964
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because the only thing
that I really want</font>

161
00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:09.570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is 5 more minutes
to tell my brother</font>

162
00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:12.650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">how I really felt about him.</font>

163
00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:16.401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did your brother believe
there was something more?</font>

164
00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:18.409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know.</font>

165
00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:22.889
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you?</font>

166
00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:24.724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Brooke, every person
reaches a point in their life</font>

167
00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:27.002
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when they ask themselves
this question.</font>

168
00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:30.044
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's nothing wrong
with you asking it, too.</font>

169
00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:35.643
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You never let
anything get to you.</font>

170
00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:37.768
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How do you do that?</font>

171
00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:42.084
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jesus.</font>

172
00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:04.324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello?</font>

173
00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:05.726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How'd it go, Amy?</font>

174
00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:08.525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Michael.</font>

175
00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:11.849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's gone.</font>

176
00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:15.169
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My cancer's--it's gone.</font>

177
00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:17.931
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my goodness!</font>

178
00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:19.530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's incredible!</font>

179
00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:25.289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know.
I just--I can't believe it.</font>

180
00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:26.765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Isn't that
what you prayed for?</font>

181
00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:31.442
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, of course. I just--</font>

182
00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:34.450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Prayer is a powerful thing,</font>

183
00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:38.963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and it turns out God has
much bigger plans for you.</font>

184
00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.843
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You okay, Grace?</font>

185
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I just can't
stop thinking about Brooke.</font>

186
00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:55.889
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, she's searching.</font>

187
00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's hurting.</font>

188
00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:01.491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah,
that's the thing about atheism.</font>

189
00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:06.208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It doesn't take away the pain;
it just takes away the hope.</font>

190
00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:08.243
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What'd you tell her?</font>

191
00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:09.725
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The truth.</font>

192
00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:12.127
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now she's free to
make her own choice.</font>

193
00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:14.129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Unfortunately,
in this day and age,</font>

194
00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:19.087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">people seem to forget that the
most basic human right of all</font>

195
00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:21.527
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is a right to know Jesus.</font>

196
00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:23.290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's put her
on the prayer list.</font>

197
00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:26.529
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Prayer always seems to be
the last thing we do,</font>

198
00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:29.928
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when it should be the first.</font>

199
00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:32.162
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, how 'bout
some more popcorn?</font>

200
00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:35.568
<font face="Comic Sans MS">With a glycemic index
of 100, not a chance.</font>

201
00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:37.887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I swear, Grace, if you
don't start feeding me better,</font>

202
00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna leave you
for a nursing home.</font>

203
00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:44.281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, that's it for me.</font>

204
00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:46.528
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going to bed.</font>

205
00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:47.920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Love ya.</font>

206
00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:49.690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love you better.</font>

207
00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:51.848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Love you first.</font>

208
00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:53.246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's unfair.</font>

209
00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:58.050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gotcha!</font>

210
00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:04.691
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Brooke, the people from
that charity place are here</font>

211
00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:06.131
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to pick up your
brother's things.</font>

212
00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:09.403
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you make sure
they get everything?</font>

213
00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:12.171
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And don't forget to
put the milk away!</font>

214
00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:25.810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">N"?</font>

215
00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:53.690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">N"?</font>

216
00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:22.650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">N"?</font>

217
00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:41.568
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, that's the last of it.
Thank you.</font>

218
00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:44.047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And, well, I was loading one
of the boxes onto the truck,</font>

219
00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:48.882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I noticed this and I thought
you might wanna keep it.</font>

220
00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So sorry for your loss.</font>

221
00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:57.090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">N"?</font>

222
00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:27.130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">N"?</font>

223
00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And so, peaceful nonviolence</font>

224
00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:38.921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">comes first in India
under Gandhi,</font>

225
00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:41.122
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and then later, here in
the United States under Dr. King</font>

226
00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:44.210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and others as a means
of achieving civil rights.</font>

227
00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:47.443
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But what makes
nonviolence so radical</font>

228
00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:50.450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is its unwavering commitment
to a nonviolent approach,</font>

229
00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:53.803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">not just initially, but in the
face of escalating persecution</font>

230
00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:56.605
<font face="Comic Sans MS">by the opposing force.</font>

231
00:14:57.560 --> 00:14:58.891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes?</font>

232
00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:00.530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Isn't that sort of
like what Jesus meant</font>

233
00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:04.281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when he said that we
should love our enemies?</font>

234
00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:08.285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

235
00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:10.562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The writer
of the Gospel of Matthew</font>

236
00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:13.451
<font face="Comic Sans MS">records Jesus as saying,
"You have heard it said,</font>

237
00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:16.046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"love your neighbor
and hate your enemy,</font>

238
00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:19.050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"but I tell you,
love your enemies</font>

239
00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:21.845
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"and pray for those
who persecute you,</font>

240
00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:25.169
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that you will be children
of your Father in heaven,"</font>

241
00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:28.449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">which indicates a commitment
to nonviolence.</font>

242
00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:29.800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. King confirmed the link,</font>

243
00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:31.763
<font face="Comic Sans MS">describing his inspiration
from Scripture,</font>

244
00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:35.566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">saying Christ furnished
the spirit and motivation,</font>

245
00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:37.762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">while Gandhi furnished
the method.</font>

246
00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:39.211
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Except that that didn't work.</font>

247
00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:42.483
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jesus got himself killed
and everybody knows that.</font>

248
00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:45.490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, so did Dr. King.</font>

249
00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:50.049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, I guess itjust depends
on how you measure success.</font>

250
00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:52.083
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Both men created movements
that survive to this day,</font>

251
00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:54.885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">even though both
paid the ultimate price</font>

252
00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.445
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for their commitment
to their ideals.</font>

253
00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:57.681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I still wouldn't do it.</font>

254
00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:59.529
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well,</font>

255
00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:01.529
<font face="Comic Sans MS">not very many people have
that kind of courage.</font>

256
00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:04.803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I, for one,
am grateful for those that do,</font>

257
00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:09.642
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you know, those who stand up
for what they believe.</font>

258
00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:17.570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have a good day.</font>

259
00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:24.963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">N"?</font>

260
00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:32.645
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you Pastor Dave?</font>

261
00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:34.131
<font face="Comic Sans MS">l am.</font>

262
00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:37.050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm Martin Yip.
- Nice to meet you.</font>

263
00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:39.288
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My friend Josh Wheaton
said you might be able</font>

264
00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:41.880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to answer my questions
about God.</font>

265
00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, that definitely falls
within my job description.</font>

266
00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:48.966
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How many questions
have you got?</font>

267
00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:53.608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So far, 147.</font>

268
00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:55.245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is something wrong?</font>

269
00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:56.646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

270
00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:58.046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Josh encouraged me
to write them down</font>

271
00:16:58.200 --> 00:16:59.531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and be as comprehensive
as possible.</font>

272
00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:01.210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course he did.</font>

273
00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:03.049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I'll have to thank him
next time I see him.</font>

274
00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:04.366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>

275
00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:05.641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, what's
your first question?</font>

276
00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:11.526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Grace,
I just have to hear it from you.</font>

277
00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:13.404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did this happen?</font>

278
00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:14.851
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you're asking
whether I responded</font>

279
00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:17.804
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to a student's question, yes.</font>

280
00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:21.208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you're asking whether
her question and my answer</font>

281
00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:23.846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">both referenced Jesus as it was
relevant to the history lesson</font>

282
00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:28.761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we were discussing,
again, I'd have to say yes.</font>

283
00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:34.286
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good afternoon, Ms. Wesley.</font>

284
00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:40.447
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've asked Bob Fessler
to sit in,</font>

285
00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:42.210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">he's the school's attorney,</font>

286
00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:47.247
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to advise us on any legal issues
we might be brushing up against.</font>

287
00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:48.805
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Should I have a lawyer, too?</font>

288
00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:50.724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I don't see
the need for that.</font>

289
00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:55.920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ms. Rizzo is present
as your union representation.</font>

290
00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:57.610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay</font>

291
00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:00.650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We are here to hear
your side of the story.</font>

292
00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:06.164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, I understand a student in
your second period history class</font>

293
00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:07.645
<font face="Comic Sans MS">asked a question
about the parallels</font>

294
00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:10.286
<font face="Comic Sans MS">between the teachings of Gandhi</font>

295
00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:13.808
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and remarks allegedly made
by Jesus.</font>

296
00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:15.968
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, that's correct.</font>

297
00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:20.449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And your answer incorporated
specific detailed reference</font>

298
00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:24.690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to those teachings that
included Scripture itself,</font>

299
00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:28.009
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the words of Jesus.</font>

300
00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:29.929
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

301
00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:31.929
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What were you thinking,
Grace?</font>

302
00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:35.010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you believe
your response was in line</font>

303
00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:37.168
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with district policy?</font>

304
00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:39.089
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

305
00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:40.406
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As well as in compliance</font>

306
00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:44.206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with state
and federal guidelines?</font>

307
00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:46.084
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, sir.</font>

308
00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:51.525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, Ms. Wesley,
unfortunately for you,</font>

309
00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:57.090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm fairly certain the
school board will disagree.</font>

310
00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:01.767
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, Coach,
you're not hearing me.</font>

311
00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:04.486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No prayers.</font>

312
00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:07.365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No moments of silence.
Nothing.</font>

313
00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:09.403
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's tradition on the field.</font>

314
00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:11.807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not on the field,
not in the locker room,</font>

315
00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:13.405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">not in the parking lot
for that matter, okay?</font>

316
00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:14.407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whatever you say.</font>

317
00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:15.646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, thanks, Coach.</font>

318
00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:17.165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on in.</font>

319
00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:18.566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi, Brooke.</font>

320
00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:20.728
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You wanted to see me?</font>

321
00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:24.208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ms. Wesley is currently
under disciplinary review.</font>

322
00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:25.731
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All of her classes
have been reassigned</font>

323
00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:27.569
<font face="Comic Sans MS">until things are settled.</font>

324
00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:29.603
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't want you to have
any contact with her.</font>

325
00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:32.724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">None whatsoever, either
on or off school property.</font>

326
00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:34.649
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do I have any say in this?</font>

327
00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:37.331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I've already discussed
things with your father</font>

328
00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:39.408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and he agrees.</font>

329
00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:42.490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Since when does my dad care?</font>

330
00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:44.364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Brooke, the important thing
for you to remember</font>

331
00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:45.402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is you've done nothing wrong.</font>

332
00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:46.601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Neither did Ms. Wesley.</font>

333
00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:48.290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All she did was
answer a question.</font>

334
00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:49.890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ms. Wesley's answer was
not in line with school policy.</font>

335
00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:51.530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really?</font>

336
00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:53.369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, aren't we allowed
to say what we believe?</font>

337
00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:54.527
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When did that change?</font>

338
00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:56.369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not gonna argue with you,</font>

339
00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:58.369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I don't want you discussing
the situation with anyone.</font>

340
00:19:58.480 --> 00:19:59.891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you understand?</font>

341
00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:02.928
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you understand?</font>

342
00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:08.610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

343
00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:24.049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Grace?</font>

344
00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:25.486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you--</font>

345
00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:28.206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tom Endler, your
union-appointed attorney.</font>

346
00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:29.765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't look like a lawyer.</font>

347
00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:31.484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

348
00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:33.443
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not sure I meant
that as a compliment.</font>

349
00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:35.085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm determined
to take it as one.</font>

350
00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:38.044
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shall we sit?</font>

351
00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:42.601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, have you defended
many teachers</font>

352
00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:44.444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in disciplinary matters?</font>

353
00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:46.164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nope, you're my first.</font>

354
00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:48.487
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just hired on from
the public defender's office.</font>

355
00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:50.130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Criminal law?</font>

356
00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:52.208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No offense,
but I'm not a criminal.</font>

357
00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:53.651
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't be so sure of that.</font>

358
00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:55.728
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your kind of case makes
everybody uncomfortable.</font>

359
00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:58.207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">School boards,
teachers, parents.</font>

360
00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:01.170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It makes them feel...yucky.</font>

361
00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:02.606
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yucky?</font>

362
00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:05.371
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that a technical
legal term?</font>

363
00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:07.482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got a better word for it?</font>

364
00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:10.001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Grace, I'm gonna
level with you.</font>

365
00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:11.685
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nobody wants your case.</font>

366
00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:14.007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I drew it because
I'm low man on the totem pole</font>

367
00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:16.009
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in a place where
seniority means everything.</font>

368
00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:19.169
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If, for whatever reason,
you're not happy with me,</font>

369
00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:21.009
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you're on your own.</font>

370
00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:24.408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're free to hire your own
attorney out of your own pocket.</font>

371
00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:27.888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Educational law isn't
exactly a common specialty.</font>

372
00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.002
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, what's the good news?</font>

373
00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:32.009
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't like to lose.</font>

374
00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:35.522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I'm willing
to fight for you.</font>

375
00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:37.165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you a believer?</font>

376
00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:39.806
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You mean a Christian?</font>

377
00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:42.161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, but I think
that's an advantage.</font>

378
00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:43.765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why?</font>

379
00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:44.927
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're passionate
about what you believe.</font>

380
00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:46.690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, let's face it,</font>

381
00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:48.529
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it's why you're in trouble
in the first place.</font>

382
00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:53.362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But it blinds you to
the realities of procedure.</font>

383
00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:57.681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay</font>

384
00:21:57.800 --> 00:21:59.131
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, what?</font>

385
00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:01.447
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, I agree to
let you represent me.</font>

386
00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:04.530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Good.
- Good.</font>

387
00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:11.969
<font face="Comic Sans MS">David, are you okay?</font>

388
00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:14.082
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um, terrific.</font>

389
00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:17.249
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There was a young man
in here, brilliant kid,</font>

390
00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:21.285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with no exposure to Scripture
until a few months ago.</font>

391
00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:24.762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He came in with some questions.</font>

392
00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:28.327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">147 of 'em to be exact.</font>

393
00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:31.922
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I feel like I've been hit
by a truck loaded with Bibles.</font>

394
00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:35.362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Big heavy ones
with those thick covers.</font>

395
00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:40.121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Always be ready to give
answer as to why you believe</font>

396
00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:43.449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the reason for your hope.</font>

397
00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:46.848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">1 Peter chapter 3, verse 15.</font>

398
00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:48.291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

399
00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:51.244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And where were you
4 hours ago?</font>

400
00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:55.720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Trust in the Lord
with all your heart</font>

401
00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:59.049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"and lean not on your
own understanding.</font>

402
00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:01.640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"In all your ways,
acknowledge him</font>

403
00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:05.765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and he will make
your paths straight."</font>

404
00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:19.048
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Father, I need you.</font>

405
00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:24.564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't do this alone.</font>

406
00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:29.971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know that you're in control.</font>

407
00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:34.688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please, give me the courage.</font>

408
00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:42.249
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In Jesus' name, amen.</font>

409
00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:51.891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Call to order.</font>

410
00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I assume Ms. Wesley understands
that this board has the power</font>

411
00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:58.244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to recommend any number
of disciplinary actions,</font>

412
00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:01.011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">up to and including
termination.</font>

413
00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:02.565
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She does.</font>

414
00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:04.284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And this board should be
aware that in the event</font>

415
00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:06.050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of such termination,</font>

416
00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:08.322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">which we would view as both
wrongful and without cause,</font>

417
00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:09.965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">she reserves
all rights of redress.</font>

418
00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:12.367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I may have a solution.</font>

419
00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:16.087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There might be a way around
all of this unpleasantness</font>

420
00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:18.407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that would satisfy all parties.</font>

421
00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:22.406
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A disciplinary notice
in Ms. Wesley's file</font>

422
00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:26.963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">stating the school board's
objections to her behavior,</font>

423
00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:29.890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a response from Ms. Wesley</font>

424
00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.731
<font face="Comic Sans MS">confessing the
inappropriateness of</font>

425
00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:36.322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and apologizing for her actions,</font>

426
00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:39.171
<font face="Comic Sans MS">along with a pledge
not to engage</font>

427
00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:44.241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in similar discussion
of Jesus in the future.</font>

428
00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:46.249
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm confident that we can
move forward on that basis.</font>

429
00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:48.567
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

430
00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:51.445
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Grace...</font>

431
00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:52.891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't.</font>

432
00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:58.764
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd like to request
a brief recess</font>

433
00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:01.008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to have a word with my client.</font>

434
00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:02.770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me.</font>

435
00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:07.843
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Grace, this is exactly
what we were hoping for.</font>

436
00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:09.803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, this is the part
where you say you're sorry,</font>

437
00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:11.524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">thank your lawyer,</font>

438
00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:15.884
<font face="Comic Sans MS">go back to your classroom,
pick up your life, and move on.</font>

439
00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:19.846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I can't do that.
- Why?</font>

440
00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:21.485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I gave an honest answer</font>

441
00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:23.409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to a student's legitimate
question in history.</font>

442
00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:24.965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Grace.</font>

443
00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:28.004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Grace, you don't
wanna do this.</font>

444
00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:32.682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the wrong decision.</font>

445
00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:34.968
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is it?</font>

446
00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:38.004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, I would rather
stand with God</font>

447
00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:40.282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and be judged by the world</font>

448
00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:45.201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">than stand with the world
and be judged by God.</font>

449
00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:51.325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am not gonna be afraid
to say the name "Jesus."</font>

450
00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:03.289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know her.
She's not gonna go for it.</font>

451
00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:04.526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How do we make this go away</font>

452
00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:06.802
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and not get blood on our hands?</font>

453
00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:08.928
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's the easy part.</font>

454
00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:11.327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We let the ACLU do it.</font>

455
00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:14.125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They'll file suit
against Ms. Wesley</font>

456
00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:17.961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and if she is found liable,
which she will be,</font>

457
00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:19.889
<font face="Comic Sans MS">then we fire her for cause.</font>

458
00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But the school district
will certainly be named</font>

459
00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:23.604
<font face="Comic Sans MS">as a codefendant.</font>

460
00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:26.121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We don't have the financial
wherewithal to fight that.</font>

461
00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:28.049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They've already been in touch.</font>

462
00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:30.970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They aren't interested
in punishing the school.</font>

463
00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:33.367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They want her.</font>

464
00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:34.766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you sure?</font>

465
00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:36.245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Trust me.</font>

466
00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:39.967
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They've been dreaming
of a case like this.</font>

467
00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:52.371
<font face="Comic Sans MS">While Ms. Wesley apologizes
for any inconvenience</font>

468
00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:55.165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">her actions may have caused,</font>

469
00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:57.362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ms. Wesley stands by
her statements,</font>

470
00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:59.164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and she does not retract
or recant them,</font>

471
00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:05.049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">either in full or in part.</font>

472
00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:08.004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So noted.</font>

473
00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:15.722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Having little choice, this board
recommends continued suspension,</font>

474
00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:18.411
<font face="Comic Sans MS">henceforth without pay,</font>

475
00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:21.046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">pending review by a court
of competent jurisdiction</font>

476
00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:23.282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to determine whether or not
Ms. Wesley violated</font>

477
00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:27.405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">local, state,
or federal guidelines.</font>

478
00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:29.761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This proceeding is adjourned.</font>

479
00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:45.011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The last thing we need is</font>

480
00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:46.246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a bunch of religious fanatics</font>

481
00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:47.930
<font face="Comic Sans MS">protesting
outside of our house.</font>

482
00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:50.202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll work to keep it
out of the media for now.</font>

483
00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:53.051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But next year, when you're
applying to all the colleges,</font>

484
00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:54.844
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you'll be able
to tell the story</font>

485
00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:57.804
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of how Brooke was part of
a landmark constitutional case</font>

486
00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:00.730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">concerning the separation
of church and state.</font>

487
00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:04.481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And believe me, there is not
an Ivy League admissions board</font>

488
00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:08.571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that could resist that.</font>

489
00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:11.286
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And think of the other
children out there,</font>

490
00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:12.765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">innocent children
who are subjected</font>

491
00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:15.969
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to their repressive
belief system.</font>

492
00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:17.923
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And not forgetting
the financial opportunities.</font>

493
00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:19.451
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

494
00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:22.131
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ms. Wesley is an employee
of the school board.</font>

495
00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:24.368
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We win in court and we
establish her misconduct</font>

496
00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:26.528
<font face="Comic Sans MS">as said paid employee,</font>

497
00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:28.569
<font face="Comic Sans MS">well, there's nothing that
changes policy faster</font>

498
00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:32.480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">than a big,
expensive settlement.</font>

499
00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:38.050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're going to prove once
and for all that God is dead.</font>

500
00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:47.570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Brooke is a minor.</font>

501
00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:50.843
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As far as the court is
concerned, she has no rights.</font>

502
00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:54.248
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That simply means I won't be
asking her to be a witness.</font>

503
00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:58.331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I feel supremely
confident about this.</font>

504
00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:07.446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay</font>

505
00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:11.403
<font face="Comic Sans MS">N"?</font>

506
00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:20.848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Injunctive relief?</font>

507
00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:22.325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're asking
that you be fired,</font>

508
00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:24.568
<font face="Comic Sans MS">plus revocation of your
teaching certificate.</font>

509
00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:26.011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?
How am I supposed to--</font>

510
00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:28.208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Plus attorney's fees.</font>

511
00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:32.848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Essentially,
you'll lose everything.</font>

512
00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why are they doing this?</font>

513
00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:36.847
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They want to make
an example of you.</font>

514
00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To them, your beliefs
are like a disease</font>

515
00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:41.169
<font face="Comic Sans MS">whose time has come and gone,</font>

516
00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:46.127
<font face="Comic Sans MS">sort of like smallpox,
or polio, or the plague.</font>

517
00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:52.169
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, what do we do?</font>

518
00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:54.282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We win.</font>

519
00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:03.850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, what's going on?</font>

520
00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:05.564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Brooke is exercising
her right to protest.</font>

521
00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:06.761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Idiot.</font>

522
00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:08.211
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, shut up, loser.</font>

523
00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:09.242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At least she's
standing for something.</font>

524
00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:10.600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give me that.</font>

525
00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:14.247
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Brooke, you need to
stop this immediately.</font>

526
00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:16.442
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Brooke, this is the last
time I'm gonna tell you.</font>

527
00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:17.971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you don't stop
this right now,</font>

528
00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:19.445
<font face="Comic Sans MS">there are gonna be
some consequences.</font>

529
00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:21.164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Actually, I don't think
that there will,</font>

530
00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:24.124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because this is a sidewalk,
which is public property.</font>

531
00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:26.163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My dad's a lawyer.</font>

532
00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:30.490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, actually, this sidewalk
is on school property.</font>

533
00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:33.291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I suggest you girls
aren't late for class.</font>

534
00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:35.801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, ma'am.</font>

535
00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:51.082
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, what are you doing?</font>

536
00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:52.844
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm just, you know,
reading the paper</font>

537
00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:57.010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">while my laptop goes through
my online jury orientation.</font>

538
00:30:57.120 --> 00:31:01.523
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, shouldn't you
be paying attention?</font>

539
00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:04.041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please remember, consumption
of alcoholic beverages,</font>

540
00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:06.401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">nonprescription drugs,
and weapons are prohibited</font>

541
00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:08.045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in the courtroom.</font>

542
00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:11.403
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Still, isn't it
your civic duty?</font>

543
00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:15.764
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Theoretically, yeah,
but Matthew 22:14.</font>

544
00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:17.405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, "Many are called,
few are chosen."</font>

545
00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:19.210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Exactly.</font>

546
00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:21.971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Three hundred people show up,
they sit around for 8 hours,</font>

547
00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:24.162
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and at the end of the day,
they all go home,</font>

548
00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:26.044
<font face="Comic Sans MS">having not been selected.</font>

549
00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:27.605
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Statistically,
I have a better chance</font>

550
00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:31.122
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of being hit by lightning.</font>

551
00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:33.044
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gotta get some coffee.</font>

552
00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:34.531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right.</font>

553
00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:36.324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's called "voir dire."</font>

554
00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:38.727
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It means that we get a chance to
eliminate any potential jurors</font>

555
00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:41.650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that may have
a bias against you.</font>

556
00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:43.125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Sir.
- Oh!</font>

557
00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:44.401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, sir.</font>

558
00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:45.521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, how are you feeling?</font>

559
00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:47.130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm good.</font>

560
00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:49.049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, well, this is
a bit of an arduous process.</font>

561
00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:51.447
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They bring all these jurors in.
It's gonna take the whole day,</font>

562
00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:53.767
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I think this is where
we can win the case.</font>

563
00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:10.322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All rise for the
Honorable Judge Robert Stennis.</font>

564
00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:13.487
<font face="Comic Sans MS">On the order of the matter</font>

565
00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:15.284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of Thawley vs. Wesley,</font>

566
00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:17.289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you may be seated.</font>

567
00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:22.402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, it says here--
what does it say?</font>

568
00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:24.443
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It says you're a psychic.</font>

569
00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:26.528
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

570
00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:28.369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, do you know
who's gonna win this case?</font>

571
00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:30.164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, don't answer that.</font>

572
00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:34.126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're going to challenge
this juror, Your Honor.</font>

573
00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:39.041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ms. Bailey,
what's your favorite TV show?</font>

574
00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:41.891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Pretty Little Liars."</font>

575
00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Peremptory challenge,
Your Honor.</font>

576
00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:48.368
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is your favorite TV show?</font>

577
00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:52.121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Duck Dynasty."</font>

578
00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:55.011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Peremptory challenge,
Your Honor.</font>

579
00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:56.764
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Duck Dynasty."</font>

580
00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:59.645
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ms. Smith, are you
involved in any community</font>

581
00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:01.091
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or charitable organizations?</font>

582
00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:03.567
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, the Salvation Army.</font>

583
00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:05.523
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll accept this juror,
Your Honor.</font>

584
00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:09.611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Juror number 9,
you're a teacher.</font>

585
00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:11.404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm a retired teacher.</font>

586
00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:14.683
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ever have any disciplinary
run-ins with the administration?</font>

587
00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:17.280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Never.</font>

588
00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:19.721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Acceptable to the plaintiff,
Your Honor.</font>

589
00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:21.330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Acceptable, Your Honor.</font>

590
00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:23.329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Peremptory challenge,
Your Honor.</font>

591
00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:24.845
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll take her, Your Honor.</font>

592
00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:26.405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, Mr. Cherry.</font>

593
00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:28.807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Preemptive challenge,
Your Honor.</font>

594
00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:32.322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Number 2
just screams Marine.</font>

595
00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:33.726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't want him.</font>

596
00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:35.365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That would mean
blowing our last challenge.</font>

597
00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:36.891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, we have no choice.</font>

598
00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:38.809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, what part of
"God, Country, and Corps"</font>

599
00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:41.002
<font face="Comic Sans MS">do you wanna put
on that jury?</font>

600
00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:44.243
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What was your
last paid position?</font>

601
00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:48.649
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Artillery Forward Observer,
United States Marine Corps.</font>

602
00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:51.366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Peremptory challenge,
Your Honor.</font>

603
00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:53.244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

604
00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:59.364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your Honor, we'd like
to challenge for cause.</font>

605
00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:01.130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why is that?</font>

606
00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:03.163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, Your Honor, the man's
an ordained minister.</font>

607
00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:06.329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Need I say more?</font>

608
00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:07.925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The juror is excused.</font>

609
00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:10.042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Objection, Your Honor.</font>

610
00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:11.491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Basis, Mr. Endler?</font>

611
00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:13.364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Discriminatory, Your Honor.</font>

612
00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:15.130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Peremptory challenges can not
be used to discriminate</font>

613
00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:17.408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">against a certain class
ofjuror based on race,</font>

614
00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:20.046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">ethnic background,
religion, or gender.</font>

615
00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:21.725
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the fact
that religious belief</font>

616
00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:26.368
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is tangential to this case
doesn't change that.</font>

617
00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:30.365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Upon further reflection,</font>

618
00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:33.563
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I find the respondent's
assertion is correct.</font>

619
00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:35.011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sustained.</font>

620
00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:37.805
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not her pastor, are you?</font>

621
00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:39.206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, Your Honor.</font>

622
00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:40.890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your Honor,
I must protest here.</font>

623
00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:42.411
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Kane,</font>

624
00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:44.488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">now, you had a set
number of peremptory challenges,</font>

625
00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:46.802
<font face="Comic Sans MS">all of which you have used.</font>

626
00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:49.002
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Therefore, it's up
to opposing counsel.</font>

627
00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:51.600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We accept him, Your Honor.</font>

628
00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:53.449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Welcome to the jury, sir.</font>

629
00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:56.928
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Henceforth,
juror number twelve.</font>

630
00:34:57.040 --> 00:35:00.203
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hope you enjoy your
service to the community.</font>

631
00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:02.800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Better chance of
being struck by lightning.</font>

632
00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:13.569
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It amazes me how we,
as human beings, think.</font>

633
00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:16.047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When I was battling for my life,</font>

634
00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:21.087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was willing to hold onto
anything, including God,</font>

635
00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:22.725
<font face="Comic Sans MS">even though I really
didn't believe in him</font>

636
00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:25.605
<font face="Comic Sans MS">until that moment.</font>

637
00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:29.566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was convinced that I felt him,</font>

638
00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:34.242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but now that
I'm officially in remission,</font>

639
00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:37.483
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I find myself
questioning everything.</font>

640
00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:45.326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, effective immediately,
this biog is the personal diary</font>

641
00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:47.966
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of one woman's
exploration of faith</font>

642
00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:52.762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">on her own terms, cancer-free.</font>

643
00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:04.164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Martin.
How's it going?</font>

644
00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:06.169
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Very good, Pastor Dave.</font>

645
00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:07.691
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, please.</font>

646
00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:14.650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You sure?</font>

647
00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:18.651
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, it seems that for
every question you answered,</font>

648
00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:21.127
<font face="Comic Sans MS">three or four more
questions spring up.</font>

649
00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:24.011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, but that's
a good thing, right?</font>

650
00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:27.369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's like what Einstein
said about science.</font>

651
00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:29.687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Picture what you know
like the light of a candle.</font>

652
00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:31.882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As the circle
of knowledge expands,</font>

653
00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:35.408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so does the circumference
of darkness around it.</font>

654
00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:37.921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, I'm actually learning,</font>

655
00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:39.724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">eventhough
I might not feel like it.</font>

656
00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:42.929
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, exactly.</font>

657
00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:46.089
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I've been studying
the Beatitudes.</font>

658
00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:48.646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're very hard,
one might say impossible,</font>

659
00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:50.888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to follow completely.</font>

660
00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here in Luke's account,
Jesus says,</font>

661
00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:56.330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Do unto others as you
have them do unto you."</font>

662
00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:58.369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But how is that possible?</font>

663
00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:00.608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How can I react to
the needs of everyone else</font>

664
00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:04.361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the same as my own,
even for one day,</font>

665
00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:06.164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">let alone my whole life?</font>

666
00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:07.611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And how can
I reconcile my inability</font>

667
00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:10.803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to do so with Scripture?</font>

668
00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:14.766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, those are good questions.</font>

669
00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:18.402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, scoot over.</font>

670
00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:21.526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is that, Luke?</font>

671
00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:23.961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, 6:20.</font>

672
00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:26.128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"And Jesus said
to his disciples,</font>

673
00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:28.720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"'You who are poor
are blessed</font>

674
00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:30.842
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"'because the kingdom of God
is yours.</font>

675
00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:33.088
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"'You who are now hungry
are blessed</font>

676
00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:34.884
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"'because you will be filled.</font>

677
00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:39.210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"'You who now weep are blessed
because you will laugh.</font>

678
00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:42.728
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"'You are blessed when people
hate you, when they exclude you,</font>

679
00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:45.810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"'insult you,
and slander your name as evil</font>

680
00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:47.843
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because of the Son of Man."'</font>

681
00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:03.011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't win.</font>

682
00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:04.406
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks.</font>

683
00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:06.090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll take that
under advisement.</font>

684
00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:08.726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, come on, you know I'm right.</font>

685
00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:10.126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, why do it?</font>

686
00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:11.924
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why go through this
whole exercise, huh?</font>

687
00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:13.610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here, thanks.</font>

688
00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:16.405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, I looked
up your history.</font>

689
00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:18.642
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're better than this.</font>

690
00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:21.161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You were third in your
class at Stanford Law.</font>

691
00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:23.851
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You clerked for a judge
on the Ninth Circuit.</font>

692
00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:25.849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why you slumming like this?</font>

693
00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:27.883
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe I believe that people
that don't do anything wrong</font>

694
00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">shouldn't suffer
at the hands of the law.</font>

695
00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:33.851
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what hate is, Tom?</font>

696
00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:35.610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not talking about
the fairy tale stuff,</font>

697
00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:38.326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean real hate.</font>

698
00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:42.604
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hate what people
like your client stand for</font>

699
00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:45.530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and what they're
doing to our society,</font>

700
00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:49.611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and Stennis does, too,
even if he doesn't admit it.</font>

701
00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:51.250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, the jury doesn't hate her.</font>

702
00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:52.691
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah, but that's
the secret, Tommy.</font>

703
00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:54.370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They don't need to hate her.</font>

704
00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:59.646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They just need to see a tiny
flaw in her, a half truth,</font>

705
00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:03.128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a small inconsistency,
just a little bit of doubt,</font>

706
00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:05.811
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and they'll find against her.</font>

707
00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:11.491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nice shoes.</font>

708
00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:27.400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You ready?</font>

709
00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:30.402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>

710
00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:32.249
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Congress shall make no law</font>

711
00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:34.488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">respecting an establishment</font>

712
00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:39.043
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of religion or prohibiting
the free exercise thereof.</font>

713
00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:40.924
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The first half of this passage</font>

714
00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:43.520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is known as
the establishment clause.</font>

715
00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:48.521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The second half is known as
the free exercise clause.</font>

716
00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:50.210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, there has been
an ongoing debate</font>

717
00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:52.721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">about what the role
of government should be,</font>

718
00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:55.684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because in practice,
these two provisions</font>

719
00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:57.962
<font face="Comic Sans MS">are often in conflict,</font>

720
00:39:58.120 --> 00:40:02.205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">which is what brings us
here today.</font>

721
00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:05.051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In the matter of
Thawley vs. Wesley,</font>

722
00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:07.561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is the plaintiff prepared to
make its opening statement?</font>

723
00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:09.011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We are, Your Honor.</font>

724
00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:11.441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then proceed.</font>

725
00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:14.928
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ladies and gentlemen,
in a jury of this size,</font>

726
00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:20.285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm imagining that there are,
probably among your ranks,</font>

727
00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:22.607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a few Christians.</font>

728
00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:25.200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hopefully practicing ones,</font>

729
00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:28.250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and that's a good thing,
that's fine,</font>

730
00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:30.767
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because Christianity
is not on trial here,</font>

731
00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:36.569
<font face="Comic Sans MS">even though my opponent will
try to convince you that it is.</font>

732
00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:39.968
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nor is faith on trial.</font>

733
00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:47.288
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Only Ms. Wesley
is on trial here today.</font>

734
00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:50.085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, ask any 4th grader</font>

735
00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:53.090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and they're probably
familiar with the phrase,</font>

736
00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:57.171
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Separation
of church and state,"</font>

737
00:40:57.280 --> 00:41:01.842
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and that is guaranteed
to us under our laws.</font>

738
00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:04.281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The plaintiffs
are the parents of a student</font>

739
00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:08.968
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in Ms. Wesley's class
who was subjected to hearing</font>

740
00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:13.290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the teachings of Jesus Christ
being favorably compared</font>

741
00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:15.562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to the teachings
of Mahatma Gandhi.</font>

742
00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:17.887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We all know
that Jesus is part</font>

743
00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:23.131
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of a particular
religious tradition.</font>

744
00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:25.766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These parents, who are
trying to raise their daughter</font>

745
00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:27.570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to be a free thinker,</font>

746
00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:30.445
<font face="Comic Sans MS">free of any religious dogma,</font>

747
00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:34.884
<font face="Comic Sans MS">are wholly offended by what
went on in that classroom.</font>

748
00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:37.480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And she, reciting the words</font>

749
00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:41.087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that were allegedly
attributed to Jesus,</font>

750
00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:44.090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who allegedly lived
2,000 years ago,</font>

751
00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:49.081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">gave a clear and
compelling indication</font>

752
00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:55.242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of what she believes,
what she supports,</font>

753
00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:57.567
<font face="Comic Sans MS">what she endorses.</font>

754
00:41:57.680 --> 00:41:59.409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, let me put it this way.</font>

755
00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:03.570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't mean to offend anyone
who may be a Muslim here,</font>

756
00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:06.365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I do not want to slight
the prophet of Islam,</font>

757
00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:09.324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but if you were to ask me a
question concerning the Quran,</font>

758
00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:11.488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the sacred text of Islam,</font>

759
00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:13.602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I could come up
with the answer</font>

760
00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:16.331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with great speed and accuracy,</font>

761
00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:20.684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I could quote
the proper surah, or chapter,</font>

762
00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:25.966
<font face="Comic Sans MS">then it would be reasonable
for you to infer</font>

763
00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:31.962
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that I was not only
a follower of Islam,</font>

764
00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:34.970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but that I considered it
to be superior</font>

765
00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:37.731
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to all other forms of religion.</font>

766
00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:43.688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If I did this in a house of
worship, that would be fine.</font>

767
00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:48.761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But if I did it in an 11th grade
classroom in a public school,</font>

768
00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:53.164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that would be preaching,
not teaching.</font>

769
00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:55.886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, why? Why in the world
are we here today?</font>

770
00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:00.403
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why? Because Ms. Wesley
refused to apologize,</font>

771
00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:02.204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and that means that
her true motivation</font>

772
00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:05.164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in that moment in her classroom</font>

773
00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:09.524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">was to take an innocent question</font>

774
00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:17.001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and turn it into an opportunity
to preach, not teach.</font>

775
00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:22.524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If we grant Ms. Wesley
the right to do that,</font>

776
00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:25.405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and by extension, everyone else,</font>

777
00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:32.005
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to violate the law based solely
on our own private beliefs,</font>

778
00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:35.886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">then our society will crumble.</font>

779
00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:37.525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I believe that.</font>

780
00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:42.680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, I implore you, please
do not set this precedent.</font>

781
00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:44.325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do not.</font>

782
00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:47.284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The future of our republic
depends on it.</font>

783
00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:04.124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's going on?</font>

784
00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:06.242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Brooke is exercising
her right to protest.</font>

785
00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:08.886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Brooke, I need you
to stop this immediately.</font>

786
00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:11.725
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Brooke, this is the last time
I'm gonna tell you.</font>

787
00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:15.083
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you don't stop right now,
there are gonna be consequences.</font>

788
00:44:16.680 --> 00:44:17.681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Aunt Amy.</font>

789
00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:19.251
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Marlene.</font>

790
00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:21.089
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I just saw the video,
what's going on?</font>

791
00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:22.611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, you remember
my friend, Brooke?</font>

792
00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:23.921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

793
00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:25.530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, she got
a teacher in trouble</font>

794
00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:26.761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for asking her about Jesus.</font>

795
00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:28.325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

796
00:44:28.440 --> 00:44:30.010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now she's not even
supposed to talk about it</font>

797
00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:32.248
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and we can't even cover it
in our school paper.</font>

798
00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:34.840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is there any way that
I could meet with her?</font>

799
00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:38.726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- The teacher?
- No, Brooke.</font>

800
00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:43.690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Endler,
your opening statement.</font>

801
00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:47.607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,</font>

802
00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:50.041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have here a copy
of the Constitution</font>

803
00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:52.003
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of the United States
of America</font>

804
00:44:52.120 --> 00:44:53.804
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and its Bill of Rights,</font>

805
00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:56.691
<font face="Comic Sans MS">arguably the two most
important documents</font>

806
00:44:56.800 --> 00:44:59.041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in the history
of our great nation.</font>

807
00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:03.051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But despite Mr. Kane's
impassioned rhetoric,</font>

808
00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:05.401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you know what you
won't find in there</font>

809
00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:07.204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">no matter how hard you look?</font>

810
00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:12.486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The phrase "Separation
of church and state."</font>

811
00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:14.204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's right.</font>

812
00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:17.210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not in there,
never has been,</font>

813
00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:18.600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because that phrase
comes from a letter</font>

814
00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:21.121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">written by Thomas Jefferson.</font>

815
00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:23.009
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, ironically,
Jefferson was writing</font>

816
00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:25.805
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to a Baptist congregation,
ensuring them</font>

817
00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:27.524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that they would always
have the right</font>

818
00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:31.565
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to believe as they wished,
free of government interference.</font>

819
00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:35.241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But lately, that phrase has
been taken out of context</font>

820
00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:37.442
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and twisted and contorted</font>

821
00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:39.449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to mean the exact opposite.</font>

822
00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:43.121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And one morning early this year,
my client, Ms. Wesley,</font>

823
00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:44.890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">she woke up as usual,</font>

824
00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">she drove to work
at her job as a teacher</font>

825
00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:49.044
<font face="Comic Sans MS">at Martin Luther King
High School,</font>

826
00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:52.084
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a place where she was
Teacher of the Year.</font>

827
00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:54.601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Her lesson plan
for second period A.P. history</font>

828
00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:59.009
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that morning, it didn't include
any mention of God or Jesus.</font>

829
00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:02.920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She didn't have a Bible sitting
on her desk in plain view.</font>

830
00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:04.485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She didn't start her class
with a blessing.</font>

831
00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:06.284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She didn't lead her
students in prayer.</font>

832
00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:12.282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, all she did was
answer a question,</font>

833
00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:15.802
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because that is what
she gets paid to do.</font>

834
00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:18.930
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, Mr. Kane will insist
loudly and often</font>

835
00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:21.042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that faith isn't on trial here,</font>

836
00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:23.401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but that is exactly
what is on trial,</font>

837
00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:27.730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the most basic human right
of all, the right to believe.</font>

838
00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:30.844
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Kane's afraid.</font>

839
00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:36.808
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's afraid that you, the jury,
the touchstone of common sense,</font>

840
00:46:36.920 --> 00:46:39.287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">might not agree with
his tortured interpretation</font>

841
00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:41.807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of the Constitution,</font>

842
00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:45.322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that you might understand
that my client has rights,</font>

843
00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:50.571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">rights that trump his agenda,
and that in realizing that</font>

844
00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:52.728
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you will hold as I do</font>

845
00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:55.446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that my client is guilty
of no wrongdoing</font>

846
00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:59.690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and innocent of any
and all claims against her.</font>

847
00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:04.007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you very much.</font>

848
00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:14.044
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And now it's become
this huge deal,</font>

849
00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:17.482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and all she did was
answer my question.</font>

850
00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:20.251
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why do you think your
parents are doing this?</font>

851
00:47:20.360 --> 00:47:22.727
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because my mom thinks
it'll help me get into Stanford</font>

852
00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:28.006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or one of the lvys, and my dad
thinks it'll help pay for it.</font>

853
00:47:28.120 --> 00:47:29.690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And nobody's asked
you what you think?</font>

854
00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:31.450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

855
00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:35.645
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, are you gonna help her?</font>

856
00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:38.525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know.</font>

857
00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:41.405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I would at least
like to talk to her.</font>

858
00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:44.046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe I could help get
her story out there.</font>

859
00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:47.528
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Great, because everyone's
telling me to stay out of it.</font>

860
00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:51.049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you always do
what you're told?</font>

861
00:47:53.080 --> 00:47:55.845
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is your heart
telling you to do?</font>

862
00:47:58.200 --> 00:48:00.407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Thawley, how did
you feel when you found out</font>

863
00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:02.608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that your daughter
had been exposed</font>

864
00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:05.803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to faith-based teachings
in class?</font>

865
00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:07.684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, it felt like
we had been violated.</font>

866
00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:09.529
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, this was supposed
to be a history class,</font>

867
00:48:09.640 --> 00:48:11.210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">not Sunday school.</font>

868
00:48:11.320 --> 00:48:13.004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My wife and I
are free thinkers.</font>

869
00:48:13.160 --> 00:48:14.605
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're rationalists.</font>

870
00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:16.245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We believe in
a non-theistic world view,</font>

871
00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:18.601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and that's how we were trying
to raise our daughter.</font>

872
00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:21.007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And did you discuss this
incident with your daughter?</font>

873
00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:22.770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I tried,</font>

874
00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:24.490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but it's hard discussing
anything with kids that age.</font>

875
00:48:24.600 --> 00:48:26.125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's 16.</font>

876
00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:28.402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Some of you know
what that's like.</font>

877
00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:31.126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's hard enough trying to
maintain credibility as a parent</font>

878
00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:33.004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">without a teacher jumping in</font>

879
00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:34.963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and arguing
against your position.</font>

880
00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:36.969
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, we trust the school
not to overstep its bounds</font>

881
00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:39.367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in terms of what is
and what isn't appropriate.</font>

882
00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:40.851
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that too much to ask?</font>

883
00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:42.450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.
Thank you, Mr. Thawley.</font>

884
00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:44.130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's all, Your Honor.</font>

885
00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:46.720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your witness, Mr. Endler.</font>

886
00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:48.763
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No questions, Your Honor.</font>

887
00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:51.486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Next witness, Mr. Kane.</font>

888
00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:56.606
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mrs. Rizzo, did Ms. Wesley
talk about faith issues</font>

889
00:48:56.720 --> 00:48:58.245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">on the school campus?</font>

890
00:48:58.360 --> 00:48:59.646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All the time.</font>

891
00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:01.808
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everybody knows
she's a Christian.</font>

892
00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:04.400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think she'd chew a stick
of gum without praying first.</font>

893
00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:06.602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It makes everyone feel awkward.</font>

894
00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:08.245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

895
00:49:08.360 --> 00:49:10.761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No further questions,
Your Honor.</font>

896
00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:13.201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your witness, Mr. Endler.</font>

897
00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:17.610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mrs. Rizzo, you stated
that Ms. Wesley</font>

898
00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:20.087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">talks about her
faith all the time.</font>

899
00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:24.364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm curious, can you
give me a specific instance?</font>

900
00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:27.126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, not off
the top of my head.</font>

901
00:49:27.240 --> 00:49:29.322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, has she,
as far as you're aware,</font>

902
00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:31.204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">ever started her class
with a prayer?</font>

903
00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:33.010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

904
00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:35.009
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Has she ever asked
anyone in the teacher's lounge</font>

905
00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:36.087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to pray with her?</font>

906
00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:37.844
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

907
00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:40.361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Has she ever asked you
personally to pray with her?</font>

908
00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:41.641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Objection, Your Honor.</font>

909
00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:43.285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No.
-Cumulative.</font>

910
00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:45.767
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The question has effectively
been asked and answered.</font>

911
00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:48.287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your Honor, Mrs. Rizzo's
sworn testimony states</font>

912
00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:51.290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that Ms. Wesley talked
about her faith all the time,</font>

913
00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:53.323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">yet she's failed to cite
a single instance.</font>

914
00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:56.603
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm merely trying to discover
some basis for her opinion.</font>

915
00:49:56.760 --> 00:49:58.410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sustained.</font>

916
00:49:58.520 --> 00:50:00.284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Endler, we're done with
this line of questioning.</font>

917
00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:03.006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mrs. Rizzo,
in the school's initial inquiry</font>

918
00:50:03.120 --> 00:50:05.646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">into this matter, you were
Ms. Wesley's representative</font>

919
00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:06.886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">on behalf
of the teacher's union,</font>

920
00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:07.887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">were you not?</font>

921
00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:09.490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

922
00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:10.886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And did you ever consider
that your disapproval</font>

923
00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:13.924
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of her faith might
taint your ability</font>

924
00:50:14.040 --> 00:50:15.326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to represent her properly?</font>

925
00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:16.521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Objection, speculative.</font>

926
00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:17.721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sustained.</font>

927
00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:20.725
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God bless you.</font>

928
00:50:20.840 --> 00:50:22.251
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Careful, or you
might end up on trial.</font>

929
00:50:22.360 --> 00:50:25.284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Endler!</font>

930
00:50:25.400 --> 00:50:27.482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No further questions,
Your Honor.</font>

931
00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:33.446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, when
are these religious zealots</font>

932
00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:36.370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">going to realize it's not only
disrespectful of them</font>

933
00:50:36.480 --> 00:50:38.289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to push their beliefs on others,</font>

934
00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:40.926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in this case,
it's actually illegal?</font>

935
00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:44.840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This woman, this fundamentalist,
used her position of influence</font>

936
00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:49.045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">as a teacher to fill the minds
of our children with nonsense.</font>

937
00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:50.969
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you ask me,
the religious extremists</font>

938
00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:54.527
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we need to worry about
are the hard-core Christians.</font>

939
00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:57.610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How about we show up in force
and show Ms. Wesley just exactly</font>

940
00:50:57.720 --> 00:51:00.007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">what we think
of her proselytizing?</font>

941
00:51:00.320 --> 00:51:01.685
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Principal Kinney, what was</font>

942
00:51:01.800 --> 00:51:05.122
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the school district's
final determination?</font>

943
00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:07.846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, Grace
has been suspended without pay</font>

944
00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:10.401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">pending the result
of this trial.</font>

945
00:51:10.520 --> 00:51:13.171
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Isn't it rather unusual,
leaving it up to a third party</font>

946
00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:17.330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to determine whether
Ms. Wesley is fired?</font>

947
00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:19.090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We've decided to accept</font>

948
00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:21.362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the court's interpretation
of wrongdoing either way.</font>

949
00:51:21.480 --> 00:51:22.811
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No questions, Your Honor.</font>

950
00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:24.331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your witness, Mr. Endler.</font>

951
00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:25.930
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ms. Kinney,</font>

952
00:51:26.040 --> 00:51:28.361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">can you tell me the full name
of the high school</font>

953
00:51:28.520 --> 00:51:30.010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">over which you preside?</font>

954
00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:33.602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Doctor Martin Luther King Junior
Memorial High School.</font>

955
00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:35.563
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I noticed that the name
fails to mention</font>

956
00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:38.126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. King's title
as Reverend Doctor.</font>

957
00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:40.647
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's his work
in the field of civil rights</font>

958
00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:42.364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that we prefer to highlight.</font>

959
00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:44.209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But that's the whole point.</font>

960
00:51:44.320 --> 00:51:46.084
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You consider
his faith and politics</font>

961
00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:48.282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to be separate things,</font>

962
00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:51.051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I don't, and he
certainly wouldn't have.</font>

963
00:51:51.160 --> 00:51:52.571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Objection, Your Honor.</font>

964
00:51:52.680 --> 00:51:54.170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Counsel is testifying.</font>

965
00:51:54.280 --> 00:51:56.089
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sustained.</font>

966
00:51:56.200 --> 00:52:00.205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jury's instructed to ignore
Mr. Endler's preceding remarks.</font>

967
00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:02.402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ms. Kinney, are you familiar
with Dr. King's letter</font>

968
00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:04.010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">from the Birmingham Jail?</font>

969
00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:05.087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, it's a seminal piece</font>

970
00:52:05.200 --> 00:52:07.168
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of civil rights history.</font>

971
00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:09.806
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In that letter
Dr. King makes numerous</font>

972
00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:11.809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">faith-based references,
does he not?</font>

973
00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:13.968
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Offhand, I don't recall.</font>

974
00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:17.129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Allow me to refresh
your memory.</font>

975
00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:22.123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He cites the example
of the three youths</font>

976
00:52:22.280 --> 00:52:25.363
<font face="Comic Sans MS">from the book of Daniel who were
tossed into the fiery furnace</font>

977
00:52:25.480 --> 00:52:28.450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">by King Nebuchadnezzar because
they refused to worship him.</font>

978
00:52:28.560 --> 00:52:31.131
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Elsewhere, he urges
action with Jesus,</font>

979
00:52:31.240 --> 00:52:33.971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and here I quote,
"Extremist love."</font>

980
00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:36.003
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And in his speech,
"I've Been to the Mountaintop,"</font>

981
00:52:36.120 --> 00:52:39.408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">he stated that he just wanted
to do God's will.</font>

982
00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:41.124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is this coming back to you now?</font>

983
00:52:41.240 --> 00:52:42.571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

984
00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:44.290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In your opinion,
would Ms. Wesley,</font>

985
00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:46.880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">had she chosen to do so,
have been allowed to present</font>

986
00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:48.604
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the examples that I just
mentioned in her class?</font>

987
00:52:48.720 --> 00:52:50.290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Objection, speculative.</font>

988
00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:51.765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going to allow it.</font>

989
00:52:51.880 --> 00:52:53.166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Overruled.</font>

990
00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:55.282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Witness may answer.</font>

991
00:52:56.040 --> 00:52:57.610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

992
00:52:57.720 --> 00:53:00.849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If it were up to me, she would
not have been allowed.</font>

993
00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:02.450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why not?</font>

994
00:53:02.560 --> 00:53:03.800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because those examples</font>

995
00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:05.046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">are too closely
associated with faith.</font>

996
00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:06.929
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In other words, they're facts,</font>

997
00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:10.806
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but they're just facts that are
too dangerous for discussion?</font>

998
00:53:10.920 --> 00:53:13.446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The word I would use would be
"controversial."</font>

999
00:53:13.560 --> 00:53:16.450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But aren't facts just facts?</font>

1000
00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:18.130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, there's
nothing controversial</font>

1001
00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:22.643
<font face="Comic Sans MS">about 2 plus 2 equaling 4,
or E equals MC squared,</font>

1002
00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:24.768
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or the date man
landed on the moon.</font>

1003
00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:27.167
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, why the controversy
about these facts?</font>

1004
00:53:27.280 --> 00:53:29.123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think the fact that
we're all here today</font>

1005
00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:31.242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">speaks for itself.</font>

1006
00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:36.128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you for your honesty.</font>

1007
00:53:38.360 --> 00:53:40.488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One last question.</font>

1008
00:53:40.600 --> 00:53:41.886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In your orientation</font>

1009
00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:43.490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">at the beginning
of the semester,</font>

1010
00:53:43.600 --> 00:53:47.525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">your memo to the staff stressed
diversity and tolerance,</font>

1011
00:53:47.640 --> 00:53:49.244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">did it not?</font>

1012
00:53:49.360 --> 00:53:51.089
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

1013
00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:54.283
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, would it be fair to say
that except for Christianity,</font>

1014
00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:56.368
<font face="Comic Sans MS">all other forms of diversity
are welcome?</font>

1015
00:53:56.480 --> 00:53:57.720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Objection!</font>

1016
00:53:57.880 --> 00:53:58.881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your Honor!</font>

1017
00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:00.650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will withdraw the question.</font>

1018
00:54:00.760 --> 00:54:02.649
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Endler,
you seem to have a penchant</font>

1019
00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:05.451
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for injecting commentary
where it doesn't belong.</font>

1020
00:54:05.560 --> 00:54:07.767
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You would do well to avoid
further provocation</font>

1021
00:54:07.880 --> 00:54:09.484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of this court.</font>

1022
00:54:09.640 --> 00:54:11.608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I apologize, Your Honor.</font>

1023
00:54:11.720 --> 00:54:14.610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll look to curtail it
in the future.</font>

1024
00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:18.490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Redirect, Your Honor?</font>

1025
00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:24.688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ms. Kinney, I understand
that you attended a service</font>

1026
00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:27.485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">at Ms. Wesley's church
a short while ago.</font>

1027
00:54:27.600 --> 00:54:28.931
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that correct?</font>

1028
00:54:29.040 --> 00:54:30.690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, that's correct.</font>

1029
00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:33.690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was an event honoring several
students who attend that church</font>

1030
00:54:33.800 --> 00:54:35.086
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for their community service.</font>

1031
00:54:35.200 --> 00:54:36.690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mm-hmm.</font>

1032
00:54:36.800 --> 00:54:39.690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And who was it that
invited you to that service?</font>

1033
00:54:39.800 --> 00:54:41.086
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Grace Wesley.</font>

1034
00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:42.690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I see.</font>

1035
00:54:42.840 --> 00:54:45.684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And where were you when
this invitation was extended?</font>

1036
00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:47.126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At my office.</font>

1037
00:54:47.240 --> 00:54:48.571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">On school grounds?</font>

1038
00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:50.643
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

1039
00:54:50.760 --> 00:54:53.047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">During work hours?</font>

1040
00:54:53.160 --> 00:54:55.891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

1041
00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:58.128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

1042
00:55:00.040 --> 00:55:02.441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, one last question.</font>

1043
00:55:02.560 --> 00:55:05.882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is it true that Ms. Wesley
accepts donations</font>

1044
00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:11.245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for a faith-based charity,
Convoy of Hope,</font>

1045
00:55:11.360 --> 00:55:14.364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">right there in the classroom?</font>

1046
00:55:14.480 --> 00:55:16.562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, she does.</font>

1047
00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:18.170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you again.</font>

1048
00:55:18.280 --> 00:55:20.601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No further questions,
Your Honor.</font>

1049
00:55:24.600 --> 00:55:27.365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You may step down, Mrs. Kinney.</font>

1050
00:55:27.480 --> 00:55:29.244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Court's adjourned.</font>

1051
00:55:33.800 --> 00:55:37.043
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Grace, can I ask you
a question,</font>

1052
00:55:37.160 --> 00:55:39.367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">off the record?</font>

1053
00:55:39.520 --> 00:55:40.931
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure.</font>

1054
00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:43.008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These people, they're
looking to destroy you,</font>

1055
00:55:43.120 --> 00:55:47.011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I don't just mean
financially.</font>

1056
00:55:47.120 --> 00:55:49.088
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you think it's worth it?</font>

1057
00:55:51.400 --> 00:55:53.721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hope so.</font>

1058
00:55:56.120 --> 00:55:58.771
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So do I.</font>

1059
00:56:14.120 --> 00:56:15.690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fishy and cheesy
at the same time.</font>

1060
00:56:15.800 --> 00:56:17.882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">David, this tuna melt
is exquisite.</font>

1061
00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:19.604
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah, exquisite.</font>

1062
00:56:19.720 --> 00:56:21.210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the provolone.</font>

1063
00:56:21.320 --> 00:56:22.810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was my idea.</font>

1064
00:56:22.920 --> 00:56:25.764
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love what it does
to the flavor of the fish.</font>

1065
00:56:25.880 --> 00:56:27.325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't I know you?</font>

1066
00:56:27.440 --> 00:56:28.965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're from
Blaze's Car Rental, right?</font>

1067
00:56:29.080 --> 00:56:30.684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah.</font>

1068
00:56:30.800 --> 00:56:34.168
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, that gig didn't
really work out for me.</font>

1069
00:56:34.280 --> 00:56:36.601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think customer
service is my forte.</font>

1070
00:56:36.720 --> 00:56:38.688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, you decided
to become a waiter?</font>

1071
00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:40.643
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, this is where
I do my dinner theatre.</font>

1072
00:56:40.760 --> 00:56:42.489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In the mornings
I serve up croissants.</font>

1073
00:56:42.600 --> 00:56:44.364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In the evenings
I serve up Chekhov.</font>

1074
00:56:44.480 --> 00:56:46.005
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh.</font>

1075
00:56:46.120 --> 00:56:50.364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, listen, sorry about
the whole car not working thing.</font>

1076
00:56:50.480 --> 00:56:51.845
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay.</font>

1077
00:56:51.960 --> 00:56:53.530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I learned my lesson.</font>

1078
00:56:53.680 --> 00:56:54.966
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He bought a Prius.</font>

1079
00:56:55.080 --> 00:56:56.525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Starts every time.</font>

1080
00:56:56.680 --> 00:56:58.045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh!</font>

1081
00:57:01.560 --> 00:57:02.846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Same guy
- Same guy</font>

1082
00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:06.043
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Amazing.</font>

1083
00:57:06.160 --> 00:57:10.484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gentlemen, I don't wanna
spoil your brunch,</font>

1084
00:57:10.600 --> 00:57:13.570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I'm hearing from
a friend of mine</font>

1085
00:57:13.680 --> 00:57:15.842
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in the prosecutor's office
about a subpoena</font>

1086
00:57:15.960 --> 00:57:20.363
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that just came down
demanding that we submit</font>

1087
00:57:20.480 --> 00:57:26.965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">copies of our sermons for
the last 3 months for review.</font>

1088
00:57:28.880 --> 00:57:30.803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can they do that?</font>

1089
00:57:30.920 --> 00:57:32.888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They tried it in Houston.</font>

1090
00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:34.365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, now the government
can determine</font>

1091
00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:36.721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">what we can and can't preach
at our churches?</font>

1092
00:57:36.840 --> 00:57:38.251
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's not overreact.</font>

1093
00:57:38.360 --> 00:57:40.089
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sure there's
no ill intent here.</font>

1094
00:57:40.200 --> 00:57:44.125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Unfortunately, I think
this is just the beginning.</font>

1095
00:57:44.240 --> 00:57:49.280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We've been ignoring it, and now
we're paying the price for it.</font>

1096
00:57:49.440 --> 00:57:51.681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, don't forget
the silent majority.</font>

1097
00:57:51.800 --> 00:57:53.131
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're out there.</font>

1098
00:57:53.280 --> 00:57:55.203
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They just need something
to stand for.</font>

1099
00:57:55.320 --> 00:57:58.005
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well I'll admit there's
pressure, but I think with time</font>

1100
00:57:58.160 --> 00:57:59.764
<font face="Comic Sans MS">this will correct itself.</font>

1101
00:57:59.880 --> 00:58:03.680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Forgive me,
but I think you're wrong.</font>

1102
00:58:03.800 --> 00:58:05.564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm serving on a jury
in a case right now</font>

1103
00:58:05.680 --> 00:58:07.284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that touches
on these issues.</font>

1104
00:58:07.400 --> 00:58:09.129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And of course, I'm not allowed
to talk about it,</font>

1105
00:58:09.240 --> 00:58:12.323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I mean, the one thing
that it's convinced me of</font>

1106
00:58:12.440 --> 00:58:14.841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is that if we stand by
and do nothing,</font>

1107
00:58:14.960 --> 00:58:16.405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">pressure that we're
feeling today</font>

1108
00:58:16.520 --> 00:58:18.443
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is gonna mean
persecution tomorrow.</font>

1109
00:58:18.560 --> 00:58:20.528
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What makes you so sure?</font>

1110
00:58:20.680 --> 00:58:25.641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Speed of change,
viciousness of the opposition.</font>

1111
00:58:25.760 --> 00:58:27.728
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The message of the gospel
has us standing in the way</font>

1112
00:58:27.840 --> 00:58:30.047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of a lot of things
that powerful people want,</font>

1113
00:58:30.160 --> 00:58:32.970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and our resistance
to change that message</font>

1114
00:58:33.080 --> 00:58:36.527
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because it's not ours to change
has made us a lot of enemies.</font>

1115
00:58:36.640 --> 00:58:39.371
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whether we admit it
or not, we're at war,</font>

1116
00:58:39.480 --> 00:58:42.324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the war of Ephesians 6,
not against flesh and blood,</font>

1117
00:58:42.440 --> 00:58:44.568
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but against the powers
of this world,</font>

1118
00:58:44.680 --> 00:58:48.002
<font face="Comic Sans MS">against the spiritual forces
in the heavenly realms.</font>

1119
00:58:48.120 --> 00:58:53.206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And if we insist
on denying that,</font>

1120
00:58:53.320 --> 00:58:56.085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">then we've already lost.</font>

1121
00:59:09.080 --> 00:59:10.809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I brought a giant bag
of Chinese food</font>

1122
00:59:10.920 --> 00:59:12.729
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and a briefcase
full of files.</font>

1123
00:59:12.840 --> 00:59:14.968
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I say we eat first.</font>

1124
00:59:15.080 --> 00:59:16.605
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I say you're a genius.</font>

1125
00:59:18.120 --> 00:59:19.610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Does Walter want to join us?</font>

1126
00:59:19.720 --> 00:59:22.041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no.
He's hiding in his room.</font>

1127
00:59:22.200 --> 00:59:23.725
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How come?</font>

1128
00:59:23.840 --> 00:59:26.491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's treating this
like it's a date,</font>

1129
00:59:26.600 --> 00:59:28.284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">which should give
you some indication</font>

1130
00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:30.050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of what my social life is like.</font>

1131
00:59:30.160 --> 00:59:31.685
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't worry,
I won't tell.</font>

1132
00:59:31.800 --> 00:59:34.644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Falls under
attorney-client privilege.</font>

1133
00:59:34.800 --> 00:59:36.450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, is this what you always
saw yourself doing,</font>

1134
00:59:36.560 --> 00:59:38.130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the lawyer thing?</font>

1135
00:59:38.240 --> 00:59:40.163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, um...</font>

1136
00:59:40.280 --> 00:59:43.363
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wanted to be Batman.</font>

1137
00:59:43.480 --> 00:59:45.050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How 'bout you?</font>

1138
00:59:45.160 --> 00:59:47.128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your parents have you all set
to go to the convent?</font>

1139
00:59:47.240 --> 00:59:49.322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Actually, there were
no bedtime prayers</font>

1140
00:59:49.480 --> 00:59:50.766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in my childhood.</font>

1141
00:59:50.880 --> 00:59:54.089
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was raised in a house
without much faith.</font>

1142
00:59:54.200 --> 00:59:56.680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When did you decide
to become a Christian?</font>

1143
00:59:56.800 --> 00:59:59.041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was walking home
from class.</font>

1144
00:59:59.160 --> 01:00:05.441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was dark, and I was
struggling with a lot of things.</font>

1145
01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:06.891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I turned the corner,</font>

1146
01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:09.520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and right there in front of me
was this church.</font>

1147
01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:12.450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It had this old sign out front,</font>

1148
01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:15.609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but it just stopped me
in my tracks.</font>

1149
01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:20.931
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the sign...
the sign said,</font>

1150
01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:25.090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Who do you say that I am?"</font>

1151
01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:30.843
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And as I read it, I could hear
the Lord speak to me.</font>

1152
01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:36.844
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know,</font>

1153
01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:40.567
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I couldn't get that question
out of my head for days,</font>

1154
01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:42.967
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so that was the start
of a journey that didn't end</font>

1155
01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:45.651
<font face="Comic Sans MS">until I found the answer.</font>

1156
01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:48.081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">N"?</font>

1157
01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.606
<font face="Comic Sans MS">N"?</font>

1158
01:02:54.880 --> 01:02:56.564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">N"?</font>

1159
01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:17.366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">N"?</font>

1160
01:03:34.920 --> 01:03:37.810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">N"?</font>

1161
01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:58.724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">N"?</font>

1162
01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:24.002
<font face="Comic Sans MS">N"?</font>

1163
01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:50.124
<font face="Comic Sans MS"> Nearer, my God, to thee </font>

1164
01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:57.562
<font face="Comic Sans MS"> Nearer to thee </font>

1165
01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:08.281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was beautiful.</font>

1166
01:05:10.360 --> 01:05:14.081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Forgive me, but I did
not know anyone was here.</font>

1167
01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:15.247
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no.
Please don't apologize.</font>

1168
01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:19.684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't mean to interrupt.</font>

1169
01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:23.088
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just didn't know
where else to go.</font>

1170
01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:26.567
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm Martin.</font>

1171
01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:28.011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm Brooke.</font>

1172
01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:33.088
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you think I could
ask you a few questions?</font>

1173
01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:40.047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That would be fine.</font>

1174
01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:42.049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good, 'cause I have a lot.</font>

1175
01:05:49.160 --> 01:05:52.369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He doesn't make mistakes.</font>

1176
01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:53.811
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I thought you proved bias.</font>

1177
01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:55.445
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, Principal Kinney
and Mrs. Rizzo?</font>

1178
01:05:55.560 --> 01:05:57.050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Those were just jabs.</font>

1179
01:05:57.160 --> 01:06:00.289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need a knockout punch.</font>

1180
01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:01.890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why did you feel compelled</font>

1181
01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to bring Jesus up
in history class?</font>

1182
01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:07.849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why shouldn't I have?</font>

1183
01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:10.201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Grace, I'm not here
to debate with you</font>

1184
01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:11.771
<font face="Comic Sans MS">what you think
your rights were as--</font>

1185
01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:14.724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, Tom, listen.</font>

1186
01:06:14.840 --> 01:06:17.081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This isn't about faith.</font>

1187
01:06:17.240 --> 01:06:19.242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is about history.</font>

1188
01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:20.691
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, maybe I'm wrong here.</font>

1189
01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:22.165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not the law expert,</font>

1190
01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:26.285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I think they've
missed the point.</font>

1191
01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:28.164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not sure I follow.</font>

1192
01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:31.250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Their whole attack, it's
about me preaching in class,</font>

1193
01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:32.885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I didn't do that.</font>

1194
01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:34.490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're saying you did.</font>

1195
01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:36.204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You cited Scripture.</font>

1196
01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:38.288
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You talked about Jesus'
teachings just like</font>

1197
01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:41.882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">they were any other
verifiable fact.</font>

1198
01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:43.650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But what if they're just that?</font>

1199
01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:46.366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, just because certain
facts happen to be recorded</font>

1200
01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:49.285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in the Bible doesn't mean
they stop being facts.</font>

1201
01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:51.249
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can separate
the history-based elements</font>

1202
01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:54.609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of Jesus' life from
the faith-based element.</font>

1203
01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:57.200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, in my classroom,
I didn't talk about Jesus</font>

1204
01:06:57.320 --> 01:06:59.482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">as my Lord and Savior.</font>

1205
01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:01.602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, all I did was
comment on quotations</font>

1206
01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:05.441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">attributed to Jesus, the man,
and I did it in A.P. History.</font>

1207
01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:07.210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There was nothing wrong
with the context.</font>

1208
01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:09.004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And any rule saying
that you can talk</font>

1209
01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:11.122
<font face="Comic Sans MS">about any historic figure
that ever existed</font>

1210
01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:14.084
<font face="Comic Sans MS">exceptJesus
is discriminatory.</font>

1211
01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:15.804
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They can't institute that.</font>

1212
01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:18.321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And every credible historian
admits that Jesus existed.</font>

1213
01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:19.930
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, there's just
too much evidence.</font>

1214
01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:21.769
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Grace, I love it.</font>

1215
01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:23.564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is our defense.</font>

1216
01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:26.968
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jesus as a historic figure,
just like everyone else.</font>

1217
01:07:27.080 --> 01:07:28.650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you know what?</font>

1218
01:07:28.760 --> 01:07:31.047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kane will never see it coming.</font>

1219
01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:42.841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got some reading to do.</font>

1220
01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:49.362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He just had so many notes
written in the margins</font>

1221
01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:52.165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that for the first time
I felt like I was</font>

1222
01:07:52.280 --> 01:07:54.726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">truly getting to know
my brother.</font>

1223
01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:58.362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like God gave me
the extra 5 minutes</font>

1224
01:07:58.480 --> 01:08:00.448
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that I so desperately
needed with him.</font>

1225
01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:06.481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just don't understand why he
never told me about his faith.</font>

1226
01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:09.211
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sharing one's faith with family,</font>

1227
01:08:09.320 --> 01:08:12.688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">especially not knowing
how they will react,</font>

1228
01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:15.326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">can be difficult.</font>

1229
01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:18.762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Count our struggles
as blessings, right?</font>

1230
01:08:20.320 --> 01:08:22.891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That is exactly right.</font>

1231
01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:31.769
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There are more than 5 minutes
awaiting you and your brother.</font>

1232
01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:36.209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">John chapter 11,
verse 25 to 26 says,</font>

1233
01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:38.766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"I am the resurrection
and the life.</font>

1234
01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:43.442
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"He who believes in me
will live even if he dies.</font>

1235
01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:46.086
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"And whoever lives
and believes in me</font>

1236
01:08:46.200 --> 01:08:48.407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">will never die."</font>

1237
01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:51.962
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you believe this?</font>

1238
01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:53.844
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I do.</font>

1239
01:08:53.960 --> 01:08:56.247
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then invite him
into your heart</font>

1240
01:08:56.400 --> 01:08:59.085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and make him
the Lord of your life.</font>

1241
01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:14.607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dear Lord, I'm not
quite sure what to say,</font>

1242
01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:21.080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but thank you for dying
on the cross for me.</font>

1243
01:09:22.280 --> 01:09:25.682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please forgive me of my sin.</font>

1244
01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:29.691
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jesus, please come
into my life,</font>

1245
01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:33.009
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I will follow you
as my Lord and Savior.</font>

1246
01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:37.849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Amen.</font>

1247
01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:42.124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">N"?</font>

1248
01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:49.928
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

1249
01:09:58.720 --> 01:10:01.166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you state your name
and occupation for the court?</font>

1250
01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:02.805
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My name is Lee Strobel.</font>

1251
01:10:02.920 --> 01:10:04.251
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm a professor
of Christian thought</font>

1252
01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:06.010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">at Houston Baptist University</font>

1253
01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:08.691
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the author of more than
2O books about Christianity,</font>

1254
01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:10.882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">including "The Case for Christ."</font>

1255
01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:14.288
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you help me prove
the existence of Jesus Christ?</font>

1256
01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:17.210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Absolutely,
beyond any reasonable doubt.</font>

1257
01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:18.845
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How so?</font>

1258
01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:20.530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Actually, this court
already affirmed it</font>

1259
01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:23.120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when we were called into session
and the date was given.</font>

1260
01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:27.046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our calendar has been split
between B.C. and A.D.</font>

1261
01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:28.804
<font face="Comic Sans MS">based on the birth of Jesus,</font>

1262
01:10:28.920 --> 01:10:31.207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">which is quite a feat
if he never existed.</font>

1263
01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:34.369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Beyond that,
historian Gary Habermas</font>

1264
01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:38.041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">lists 39 ancient sources
for Jesus,</font>

1265
01:10:38.160 --> 01:10:41.642
<font face="Comic Sans MS">from which he enumerates
more than 100 reported facts</font>

1266
01:10:41.760 --> 01:10:46.448
<font face="Comic Sans MS">about his life, teachings,
crucifixion, and resurrection.</font>

1267
01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:49.769
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In fact, the historical evidence
for Jesus' execution</font>

1268
01:10:49.880 --> 01:10:52.690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is so strong that
one of the most famous</font>

1269
01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:55.007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">New Testament scholars
in the world,</font>

1270
01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:58.602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gerd Ludemann of Germany,
said, "Jesus' death</font>

1271
01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:02.361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">as a consequence of crucifixion
is indisputable."</font>

1272
01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:05.006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, there are very few facts
in ancient history</font>

1273
01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:07.566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that a critical historian
like Gerd Ludemann</font>

1274
01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:10.206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">will say is indisputable.</font>

1275
01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:13.449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One of them is the execution
of Jesus Christ.</font>

1276
01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:15.050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Forgive me,
but you're a believer,</font>

1277
01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:16.491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">are you not?</font>

1278
01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:17.761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A Bible-believing Christian?</font>

1279
01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:19.370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guilty as charged.</font>

1280
01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:22.131
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, wouldn't this tend
to inflate your estimate</font>

1281
01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:24.971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of the probability
that Jesus existed.</font>

1282
01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:27.367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, because we
don't need to inflate it.</font>

1283
01:11:27.480 --> 01:11:30.768
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can reconstruct
the basic facts about Jesus</font>

1284
01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:34.930
<font face="Comic Sans MS">just from non-Christian sources
outside the Bible.</font>

1285
01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:37.805
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And Gerd Ludemann is an atheist.</font>

1286
01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:41.288
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In other words, we can prove
the existence of Jesus</font>

1287
01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:43.966
<font face="Comic Sans MS">solely by using sources
that have absolutely</font>

1288
01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:46.447
<font face="Comic Sans MS">no sympathy toward Christianity.</font>

1289
01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:49.564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As the agnostic historian,
Bart Ehrman, says,</font>

1290
01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:53.890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Jesus did exist,
whether we like it or not."</font>

1291
01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I put it this way:</font>

1292
01:11:56.240 --> 01:11:59.801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Denying the existence of Jesus
doesn't make him go away.</font>

1293
01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:04.170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It merely proves that no amount
of evidence will convince you.</font>

1294
01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:05.850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

1295
01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:08.850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No further questions,
Your Honor.</font>

1296
01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:12.089
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Kane, your witness.</font>

1297
01:12:12.200 --> 01:12:14.328
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No questions, Your Honor.</font>

1298
01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:15.771
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's lunch.</font>

1299
01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:18.247
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll recess until 2 p.m.</font>

1300
01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:28.769
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can I help you with something?</font>

1301
01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:30.644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, hi.</font>

1302
01:12:30.760 --> 01:12:33.570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was looking for Pastor Dave.</font>

1303
01:12:33.680 --> 01:12:37.651
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My friend, Mina, she said
I should come see him.</font>

1304
01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:40.604
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She said he's real
easy to talk to.</font>

1305
01:12:40.720 --> 01:12:42.609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He won't be back
until after next week.</font>

1306
01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:44.802
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, okay.
Thanks.</font>

1307
01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:48.248
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sweeping is something
I only do part-time.</font>

1308
01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:51.170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I enjoy it because
it helps me think.</font>

1309
01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:56.002
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But if you need to talk,
I'm actually a pastor.</font>

1310
01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:02.529
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's been 3 weeks
since my doctors told me</font>

1311
01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:04.051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was in remission.</font>

1312
01:13:04.160 --> 01:13:05.685
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, Amy, that's wonderful.</font>

1313
01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:06.722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is.</font>

1314
01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:08.524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

1315
01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:13.487
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But even though
I've been given this gift,</font>

1316
01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:17.650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've been questioning my faith.</font>

1317
01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:22.687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know Jesus existed,
but I'm struggling to believe.</font>

1318
01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:25.406
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Actually,
I think you already do believe,</font>

1319
01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:27.761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the proof is you're
not willing to put God</font>

1320
01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:31.049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">back on the shelf
now that your cancer is gone.</font>

1321
01:13:31.160 --> 01:13:34.687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He won't let you dismiss
the thought of him.</font>

1322
01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:36.928
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Part of you senses
Jesus' presence</font>

1323
01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:41.170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and wishes that he would just
go away and leave you alone.</font>

1324
01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:43.806
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Actually, now
that you mention it,</font>

1325
01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:46.048
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had thought of that.</font>

1326
01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:51.326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, he delights in using us
in ways we never dreamed of</font>

1327
01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:55.365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and giving us things that we
never even knew we wanted.</font>

1328
01:13:55.480 --> 01:13:58.563
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We just have to give him
a chance.</font>

1329
01:13:58.680 --> 01:14:00.648
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Will you?</font>

1330
01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:07.728
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

1331
01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:15.328
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi, I'm Reverend David Hill.</font>

1332
01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:17.442
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sermon transcripts, right?</font>

1333
01:14:17.560 --> 01:14:19.050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yes.
- Just put it right there.</font>

1334
01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:21.367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They've been coming
in all morning.</font>

1335
01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:27.210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sure they did what
they thought was best.</font>

1336
01:14:31.320 --> 01:14:33.049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's it?</font>

1337
01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:36.562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Those are your entire sermons
for the past 120 days?</font>

1338
01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:38.364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, that's a letter
that I wrote</font>

1339
01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:41.643
<font face="Comic Sans MS">explaining why I'm not going
to hand them in.</font>

1340
01:14:41.760 --> 01:14:43.842
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me?</font>

1341
01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:45.729
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know it's unusual
for a Christian pastor</font>

1342
01:14:45.840 --> 01:14:47.490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to willfully resist a subpoena</font>

1343
01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:50.285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">issued by a lawful
government authority,</font>

1344
01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:51.731
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and it's even more unusual</font>

1345
01:14:51.880 --> 01:14:54.929
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that he should feel
compelled to do so.</font>

1346
01:14:55.040 --> 01:14:58.886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you sure
you wanna do that?</font>

1347
01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.685
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's something
that I have to do.</font>

1348
01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:03.325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know the old saying,
"The squeaky wheel</font>

1349
01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:05.522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">gets the grease,"
don't you?</font>

1350
01:15:05.640 --> 01:15:07.608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have another saying:</font>

1351
01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:12.203
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"A nail that sticks up
gets hammered down."</font>

1352
01:15:40.920 --> 01:15:43.127
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Susan, what I'm seeing
is a teacher who answered</font>

1353
01:15:43.240 --> 01:15:45.288
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a student's question
to the best of her ability.</font>

1354
01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:46.890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Amy, it sounds like
you're taking the side</font>

1355
01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:48.286
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of Grace Wesley here.</font>

1356
01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:50.562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Surely, you see that she used
the student's question</font>

1357
01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:52.409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to promote her Christian agenda.</font>

1358
01:15:52.520 --> 01:15:54.522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Actually, Susan,
that's not how I see it.</font>

1359
01:15:54.640 --> 01:15:57.120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I believe Ms. Wesley's entitled
to her own opinions,</font>

1360
01:15:57.280 --> 01:15:59.009
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and that includes
in the classroom.</font>

1361
01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:01.646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She didn't try to convert these
students, in fact--</font>

1362
01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:04.001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Amy, I must say,
I'm shocked at what seems to be</font>

1363
01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:07.642
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a complete 180 from the typical
stance of your plot.</font>

1364
01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:09.842
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just look at the facts
of this case for a minute.</font>

1365
01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:13.243
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She clearly infringed on
the rights of her students.</font>

1366
01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:15.169
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Marlene?</font>

1367
01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:16.805
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have an idea.</font>

1368
01:16:16.920 --> 01:16:18.285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come over as soon
as you can, okay?</font>

1369
01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:22.731
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You look terrible.</font>

1370
01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:24.171
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You really ought to
ask to be excused.</font>

1371
01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:25.520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, I'm fine.</font>

1372
01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:27.967
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I really need to be here.</font>

1373
01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:30.048
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All rise.</font>

1374
01:16:32.680 --> 01:16:36.162
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You may be seated.</font>

1375
01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:38.129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Juror number 12, is there
something you'd like to say?</font>

1376
01:16:38.280 --> 01:16:41.045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, Your Honor,
I gotta--</font>

1377
01:16:42.600 --> 01:16:43.886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bailiff, call paramedics.</font>

1378
01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:45.684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir.</font>

1379
01:16:45.800 --> 01:16:47.404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I guess
that proves there is no God,</font>

1380
01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:48.806
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'cause they just lost
the only juror</font>

1381
01:16:48.920 --> 01:16:50.206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">they could count on.</font>

1382
01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:54.765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Any dizziness?</font>

1383
01:16:54.920 --> 01:16:56.649
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah.
- Vomiting?</font>

1384
01:16:56.760 --> 01:16:58.091
<font face="Comic Sans MS">About a half hour ago.</font>

1385
01:16:58.200 --> 01:16:59.326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Does this hurt?
How 'bout this?</font>

1386
01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:02.087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hope you're not too attached</font>

1387
01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:03.167
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to your appendix.</font>

1388
01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:29.602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Brooke!
Marlene.</font>

1389
01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:33.649
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not looking good in there.</font>

1390
01:18:02.200 --> 01:18:04.487
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ms. Marshall,
are you prepared to fulfill</font>

1391
01:18:04.600 --> 01:18:06.204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">your duties as an alternate?</font>

1392
01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:08.322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, I am, Your Honor.</font>

1393
01:18:08.440 --> 01:18:10.363
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Endler, next witness.</font>

1394
01:18:10.480 --> 01:18:13.165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Would you state your name
and experience for the record?</font>

1395
01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:14.884
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My name is
James Warner Wallace.</font>

1396
01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:17.725
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm a retired homicide detective
from Los Angeles County.</font>

1397
01:18:17.880 --> 01:18:20.281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And are you the author of the
book, "Cold Case Christianity"?</font>

1398
01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:22.004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, I am.</font>

1399
01:18:22.120 --> 01:18:24.805
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you share the subtitle of
the book with the court, please?</font>

1400
01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:26.251
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"A Homicide Detective</font>

1401
01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:27.885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Investigates the Claims
of the Gospels."</font>

1402
01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:29.286
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Would I be correct in saying</font>

1403
01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:31.641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that your duties as
a homicide detective</font>

1404
01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:33.888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">include investigating
cold case homicides?</font>

1405
01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, that is
and was my expertise.</font>

1406
01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:39.609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't most of those cases
get solved with DNA evidence?</font>

1407
01:18:39.720 --> 01:18:41.245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Objection, leading.</font>

1408
01:18:41.400 --> 01:18:43.448
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And counsel is
testifying again, Your Honor.</font>

1409
01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:44.846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll rephrase.</font>

1410
01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:47.611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How many of your
cold cases were solved</font>

1411
01:18:47.720 --> 01:18:49.529
<font face="Comic Sans MS">through the use
of DNA evidence?</font>

1412
01:18:49.640 --> 01:18:51.244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">None. Not one.</font>

1413
01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:52.771
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's often popular on TV,</font>

1414
01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:54.405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but our departments
never had the good fortune</font>

1415
01:18:54.520 --> 01:18:56.602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of solving a cold case
with DNA.</font>

1416
01:18:56.720 --> 01:18:58.927
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, how do most
of these cases get solved?</font>

1417
01:18:59.040 --> 01:19:01.042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Often by examining
eyewitness claims,</font>

1418
01:19:01.160 --> 01:19:03.288
<font face="Comic Sans MS">witness claims that were
made many years earlier,</font>

1419
01:19:03.400 --> 01:19:06.290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">even though often our
witnesses are now deceased.</font>

1420
01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:07.811
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Forgive my ignorance,
Mr. Wallace,</font>

1421
01:19:07.920 --> 01:19:09.888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but how is that possible?</font>

1422
01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:11.843
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, we have a number
of techniques we can use</font>

1423
01:19:11.960 --> 01:19:13.564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to test the reliability
of an eyewitness,</font>

1424
01:19:13.680 --> 01:19:16.968
<font face="Comic Sans MS">including something called
forensic statement analysis.</font>

1425
01:19:17.080 --> 01:19:18.491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's a discipline where
we scrutinize the statements</font>

1426
01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:19.965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of eyewitnesses</font>

1427
01:19:20.080 --> 01:19:21.650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and looking at what
they choose to minimize,</font>

1428
01:19:21.760 --> 01:19:24.081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">what they choose to emphasize,
what they omit altogether,</font>

1429
01:19:24.200 --> 01:19:26.680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">how they expand time
or contract time.</font>

1430
01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:29.326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And when we examine these
kinds of eyewitness accounts,</font>

1431
01:19:29.440 --> 01:19:31.966
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we can usually tell who's lying,
and who's telling the truth,</font>

1432
01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:34.327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and even who
the guilty party is.</font>

1433
01:19:34.440 --> 01:19:36.329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And did you apply
this skill set anytime</font>

1434
01:19:36.440 --> 01:19:38.329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">outside of your
official capacity?</font>

1435
01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:41.523
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, I applied my expertise
to the death of Jesus</font>

1436
01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:43.005
<font face="Comic Sans MS">at the hands of the Romans,</font>

1437
01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:45.168
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I actually looked at
the gospels</font>

1438
01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:48.443
<font face="Comic Sans MS">as I would any other set
of forensic statements.</font>

1439
01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:49.891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Within a matter of months,</font>

1440
01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:51.525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I determined
that the four gospels,</font>

1441
01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:53.205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">written from different
perspectives,</font>

1442
01:19:53.320 --> 01:19:56.403
<font face="Comic Sans MS">contained the eyewitness
accounts about the life,</font>

1443
01:19:56.560 --> 01:19:59.166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">ministry, death,
and resurrection of Jesus.</font>

1444
01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:01.009
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And did you consider
that the four accounts</font>

1445
01:20:01.120 --> 01:20:03.566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">might be part of a conspiracy,</font>

1446
01:20:03.680 --> 01:20:06.160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">designed to promote belief
in a fledgling faith?</font>

1447
01:20:06.320 --> 01:20:07.606
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, you have
to consider conspiracies</font>

1448
01:20:07.720 --> 01:20:09.529
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when assessing
eyewitness accounts,</font>

1449
01:20:09.640 --> 01:20:11.051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but successful conspiracies</font>

1450
01:20:11.200 --> 01:20:13.931
<font face="Comic Sans MS">typically involve
the fewest number of people.</font>

1451
01:20:14.040 --> 01:20:16.202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a lot easier for 2 people
to lie and keep a secret</font>

1452
01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:18.004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">than it is for 20.</font>

1453
01:20:18.120 --> 01:20:19.849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And that's really the problem
with the conspiracy theories</font>

1454
01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:21.764
<font face="Comic Sans MS">related to the apostles
in the 1st century.</font>

1455
01:20:21.920 --> 01:20:23.410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There are just
far too many of them</font>

1456
01:20:23.520 --> 01:20:24.885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">trying to hold
this conspiracy</font>

1457
01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:26.286
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for far too long
a period of time.</font>

1458
01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:27.925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And far worse,</font>

1459
01:20:28.040 --> 01:20:30.407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">they're experiencing
pressure like no other,</font>

1460
01:20:30.520 --> 01:20:31.885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">unimaginable pressure.</font>

1461
01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.731
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Every one of these folks
was tortured and died</font>

1462
01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:36.171
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for what they claimed to see,</font>

1463
01:20:36.280 --> 01:20:39.090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and none of them
ever recanted their story.</font>

1464
01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:42.727
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, the idea that this is a
conspiracy in the 1st century</font>

1465
01:20:42.840 --> 01:20:44.410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is just really unreasonable.</font>

1466
01:20:44.520 --> 01:20:46.090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Instead, what
I see in the gospels</font>

1467
01:20:46.200 --> 01:20:49.488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is something I call unintended
eyewitness support statement.</font>

1468
01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:52.001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's an unintended
eyewitness support statement?</font>

1469
01:20:52.120 --> 01:20:54.009
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If I can borrow your Bible?</font>

1470
01:20:58.120 --> 01:21:00.885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me go to
the Gospel of Matthew</font>

1471
01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:02.166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for an example of this.</font>

1472
01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:03.805
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll start with a passage</font>

1473
01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:06.531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in which Jesus is in front
of Caiaphas at a hearing.</font>

1474
01:21:06.640 --> 01:21:08.563
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It says here,
"Then they spit in his face</font>

1475
01:21:08.680 --> 01:21:10.489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"and struck him
with their fists.</font>

1476
01:21:10.600 --> 01:21:12.045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Others slapped him
and said,</font>

1477
01:21:12.160 --> 01:21:14.447
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'Prophesy to us, Christ.
Who hit you?"'</font>

1478
01:21:14.560 --> 01:21:16.244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, that seems like
a very simple request,</font>

1479
01:21:16.360 --> 01:21:17.691
<font face="Comic Sans MS">given that
the people who hit him</font>

1480
01:21:17.800 --> 01:21:18.847
<font face="Comic Sans MS">are standing
right in front of him.</font>

1481
01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:20.530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This makes no sense.</font>

1482
01:21:20.640 --> 01:21:23.291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why would it be prophecy to be
able to tell you who hit you?</font>

1483
01:21:23.440 --> 01:21:26.091
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But it's not until you read Luke
that you get an answer to this.</font>

1484
01:21:26.200 --> 01:21:28.931
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He says, "The men
who were guarding Jesus</font>

1485
01:21:29.040 --> 01:21:31.088
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"began mocking
and beating him.</font>

1486
01:21:31.240 --> 01:21:33.083
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"They blindfolded him
and demanded,</font>

1487
01:21:33.240 --> 01:21:34.526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'Prophesy, who hit you?"'</font>

1488
01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:36.608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, now we know why
this was a challenge,</font>

1489
01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:38.609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'cause Luke tells us the
thing that Matthew left out,</font>

1490
01:21:38.720 --> 01:21:40.927
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that he was actually blindfolded
at the time this took place.</font>

1491
01:21:41.080 --> 01:21:42.491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is very common,</font>

1492
01:21:42.600 --> 01:21:44.568
<font face="Comic Sans MS">this kind of unintentional
eyewitness support</font>

1493
01:21:44.680 --> 01:21:47.968
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that fills in a detail
that the first witness left out.</font>

1494
01:21:48.080 --> 01:21:50.686
<font face="Comic Sans MS">After years of scrutinizing
these gospels using the template</font>

1495
01:21:50.840 --> 01:21:53.571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that I use to determine
if an eyewitness is reliable,</font>

1496
01:21:53.720 --> 01:21:56.326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I concluded that the
four gospels in this book</font>

1497
01:21:56.440 --> 01:22:00.729
<font face="Comic Sans MS">contained the reliable accounts
of the actual words of Jesus.</font>

1498
01:22:02.840 --> 01:22:04.569
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And that's to include
the statements</font>

1499
01:22:04.680 --> 01:22:06.728
<font face="Comic Sans MS">quoted by Ms. Wesley
in her class?</font>

1500
01:22:06.840 --> 01:22:11.129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Absolutely.</font>

1501
01:22:11.280 --> 01:22:13.886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, Detective.</font>

1502
01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:17.402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your witness.</font>

1503
01:22:17.520 --> 01:22:19.648
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Detective Wallace,</font>

1504
01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:24.641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not gonna try to match
biblical knowledge with you.</font>

1505
01:22:24.760 --> 01:22:28.287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But isn't it true that these
gospel accounts vary widely</font>

1506
01:22:28.400 --> 01:22:29.925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in what they say,</font>

1507
01:22:30.040 --> 01:22:31.201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that there are
numerous discrepancies</font>

1508
01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:33.163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">between these accounts?</font>

1509
01:22:33.280 --> 01:22:37.285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Absolutely, but that's
exactly what we should expect.</font>

1510
01:22:37.400 --> 01:22:39.607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't quite understand that.</font>

1511
01:22:39.720 --> 01:22:41.051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, reliable eyewitness
accounts always differ slightly</font>

1512
01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:42.207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in the way
they recall the story.</font>

1513
01:22:42.320 --> 01:22:43.924
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're coming to it</font>

1514
01:22:44.040 --> 01:22:45.326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">from different geographic
perspectives, their history,</font>

1515
01:22:45.480 --> 01:22:47.084
<font face="Comic Sans MS">even where they are
located in the room.</font>

1516
01:22:47.200 --> 01:22:49.441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When I examined the gospels,
I was trying to determine</font>

1517
01:22:49.560 --> 01:22:51.642
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if these were accurate,
reliable accounts,</font>

1518
01:22:51.760 --> 01:22:53.364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in spite of any differences</font>

1519
01:22:53.480 --> 01:22:55.528
<font face="Comic Sans MS">there might be
between the accounts.</font>

1520
01:22:55.640 --> 01:22:58.644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah, and as a devout Christian,</font>

1521
01:22:58.760 --> 01:23:00.285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you feel you succeeded?</font>

1522
01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:01.925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah, Mr. Kane.</font>

1523
01:23:02.080 --> 01:23:03.525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think you misunderstand me.</font>

1524
01:23:03.640 --> 01:23:06.405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When I began this study,
I was a devout atheist.</font>

1525
01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:09.683
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I began examining the gospels
as a committed skeptic,</font>

1526
01:23:09.800 --> 01:23:11.928
<font face="Comic Sans MS">not as a believer.</font>

1527
01:23:12.040 --> 01:23:14.520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You see, I wasn't raised
in a Christian environment,</font>

1528
01:23:14.640 --> 01:23:16.768
<font face="Comic Sans MS">although I do think I have
an unusually high regard</font>

1529
01:23:16.880 --> 01:23:18.370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for the value of evidence.</font>

1530
01:23:18.480 --> 01:23:20.369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not a Christian
because I was raised that way</font>

1531
01:23:20.480 --> 01:23:22.721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or because I hoped
it would satisfy some need</font>

1532
01:23:22.840 --> 01:23:24.683
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or accomplish some goal.</font>

1533
01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:28.247
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm simply a Christian
because it's evidentially true.</font>

1534
01:23:31.560 --> 01:23:33.130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Motion to strike, Your Honor.</font>

1535
01:23:33.240 --> 01:23:35.049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Granted.</font>

1536
01:23:35.160 --> 01:23:39.245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jury's instructed to ignore
Detective Wallace's last remark.</font>

1537
01:23:39.360 --> 01:23:41.249
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No further questions.</font>

1538
01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:43.124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Witness is excused.</font>

1539
01:23:43.240 --> 01:23:44.969
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, Your Honor.</font>

1540
01:23:51.160 --> 01:23:52.889
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Endler, your next witness.</font>

1541
01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:56.129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We don't have one, Your Honor.</font>

1542
01:23:56.240 --> 01:23:58.527
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She didn't do anything wrong;
she was just trying to help me!</font>

1543
01:23:58.640 --> 01:24:00.449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Brooke!</font>

1544
01:24:00.560 --> 01:24:02.130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Order!
I'll have order!</font>

1545
01:24:02.240 --> 01:24:04.447
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Young lady,
your youth is no excuse</font>

1546
01:24:04.600 --> 01:24:07.206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for disturbing
the sanctity of this court.</font>

1547
01:24:07.320 --> 01:24:09.288
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But this case is
supposed to be about me.</font>

1548
01:24:09.440 --> 01:24:10.930
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm almost 17 years old;</font>

1549
01:24:11.040 --> 01:24:12.405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it's not like I can't
think for myself.</font>

1550
01:24:12.520 --> 01:24:14.249
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just don't have
the right to speak.</font>

1551
01:24:14.400 --> 01:24:16.402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Brooke, what are you doing?
- Not unless you are called</font>

1552
01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:18.045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">as a witness, young lady.</font>

1553
01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:20.811
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If I put her on the stand,
what am I gonna hear?</font>

1554
01:24:20.920 --> 01:24:23.048
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That she asked a question
and I answered it.</font>

1555
01:24:25.600 --> 01:24:28.683
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your Honor, we'd like to call
Ms. Brooke Thawley to the stand.</font>

1556
01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:30.211
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Objection, Your Honor!</font>

1557
01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:31.924
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ms. Thawley is a minor.</font>

1558
01:24:32.040 --> 01:24:33.963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Her parents do not
want her subjected</font>

1559
01:24:34.080 --> 01:24:35.525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to the emotional pressure</font>

1560
01:24:35.640 --> 01:24:38.120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of testifying against
her own teacher.</font>

1561
01:24:38.240 --> 01:24:42.450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ms. Thawley, are you willing
to testify on your own behalf?</font>

1562
01:24:42.560 --> 01:24:43.800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, Your Honor.</font>

1563
01:24:43.920 --> 01:24:44.921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And do you understand</font>

1564
01:24:45.040 --> 01:24:46.201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that you will have to answer</font>

1565
01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:47.367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">all the questions truthfully,</font>

1566
01:24:47.480 --> 01:24:49.323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">regardless of your feelings,</font>

1567
01:24:49.480 --> 01:24:53.724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and that failure to do so
is punishable by law?</font>

1568
01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:55.001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, Your Honor.</font>

1569
01:24:55.120 --> 01:24:56.565
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not afraid
of telling the truth.</font>

1570
01:24:56.680 --> 01:25:00.048
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm only afraid
of not being able to tell it.</font>

1571
01:25:02.760 --> 01:25:07.004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">N"?</font>

1572
01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:14.925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will allow this witness.</font>

1573
01:25:15.040 --> 01:25:17.884
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Objection overruled.</font>

1574
01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:25.170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Brooke, in class,</font>

1575
01:25:25.280 --> 01:25:26.930
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who first brought up
the name "Jesus,"</font>

1576
01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:28.326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you or Ms. Wesley?</font>

1577
01:25:28.440 --> 01:25:29.771
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I did.</font>

1578
01:25:29.880 --> 01:25:31.291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As part of a question?</font>

1579
01:25:31.400 --> 01:25:32.765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

1580
01:25:32.880 --> 01:25:34.609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And at that time,</font>

1581
01:25:34.720 --> 01:25:37.530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">did you feel like you were
asking a faith-based question?</font>

1582
01:25:37.640 --> 01:25:39.085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, not really.</font>

1583
01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:41.362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It just seemed like
Martin Luther King and Jesus</font>

1584
01:25:41.480 --> 01:25:44.723
<font face="Comic Sans MS">were saying similar things,
so I brought it up.</font>

1585
01:25:44.840 --> 01:25:46.808
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And did you consider
Ms. Wesley's response</font>

1586
01:25:46.920 --> 01:25:49.969
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to be a reasonable answer
to your question?</font>

1587
01:25:50.120 --> 01:25:51.690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

1588
01:25:51.800 --> 01:25:54.201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, if I'm hearing you
correctly,</font>

1589
01:25:54.320 --> 01:26:00.248
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you asked a question in history
class about a historical figure,</font>

1590
01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:02.647
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and your history teacher
answered it</font>

1591
01:26:02.800 --> 01:26:03.847
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in a sensible manner?</font>

1592
01:26:03.960 --> 01:26:05.928
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

1593
01:26:08.240 --> 01:26:10.891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

1594
01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your witness.</font>

1595
01:26:22.360 --> 01:26:26.206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ms. Thawley,
do you like Ms. Wesley?</font>

1596
01:26:26.320 --> 01:26:27.890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

1597
01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Would you say she's
your favorite teacher?</font>

1598
01:26:30.320 --> 01:26:32.049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, absolutely.</font>

1599
01:26:32.160 --> 01:26:33.889
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you think
Ms. Wesley likes you?</font>

1600
01:26:34.040 --> 01:26:36.247
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Objection, speculative.</font>

1601
01:26:36.360 --> 01:26:39.364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your Honor, speaks to the
state of mind of the witness,</font>

1602
01:26:39.480 --> 01:26:41.164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if not Ms. Wesley herself.</font>

1603
01:26:41.280 --> 01:26:43.169
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna allow it. Overruled.</font>

1604
01:26:43.280 --> 01:26:45.886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You may answer the question.</font>

1605
01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:47.843
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, I think she likes me.</font>

1606
01:26:47.960 --> 01:26:49.325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh-huh.</font>

1607
01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:50.771
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you think
there's any possibility</font>

1608
01:26:50.880 --> 01:26:53.531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that in answering your question,</font>

1609
01:26:53.640 --> 01:26:58.441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">she may have tried to share
some of the ideas of her faith,</font>

1610
01:26:58.560 --> 01:27:00.881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a faith that she holds
most dear?</font>

1611
01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, uh,
no, not at that moment.</font>

1612
01:27:03.440 --> 01:27:05.488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not at that moment.</font>

1613
01:27:05.600 --> 01:27:07.329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You mean to say that
there were other moments</font>

1614
01:27:07.440 --> 01:27:10.489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in which she talked to you
about her faith?</font>

1615
01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:16.488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hmm? Ms. Thawley, please?</font>

1616
01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:19.649
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You must answer
the question, Ms. Thawley.</font>

1617
01:27:22.400 --> 01:27:24.767
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, but it was
outside of school</font>

1618
01:27:24.880 --> 01:27:26.245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and it was only one time.</font>

1619
01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:28.442
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Move to strike.
Your Honor, this is irrelevant.</font>

1620
01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:30.961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No actions off the school
campus are at issue here.</font>

1621
01:27:31.080 --> 01:27:32.491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Denied.</font>

1622
01:27:32.640 --> 01:27:34.369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Kane seems to have
found a loose thread.</font>

1623
01:27:34.480 --> 01:27:36.528
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm inclined to let him pull it.</font>

1624
01:27:36.640 --> 01:27:38.563
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See what unravels.</font>

1625
01:27:38.680 --> 01:27:39.920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, Your Honor.</font>

1626
01:27:40.040 --> 01:27:41.644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why didn't you
tell me about this?</font>

1627
01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:45.207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You didn't ask,
and I didn't think it mattered.</font>

1628
01:27:45.360 --> 01:27:48.569
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Brooke, you realize that
you have to tell the truth here.</font>

1629
01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:49.841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You understand that, correct?</font>

1630
01:27:49.960 --> 01:27:51.405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

1631
01:27:51.520 --> 01:27:53.249
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, what did you mean
when you said</font>

1632
01:27:53.360 --> 01:27:58.685
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that you had talks
about faith outside of school?</font>

1633
01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:06.969
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My brother died in an accident
6 months ago.</font>

1634
01:28:07.080 --> 01:28:09.401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ms. Wesley noticed that
I wasn't doing so well,</font>

1635
01:28:09.520 --> 01:28:12.444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so she asked me if everything
was all right after class.</font>

1636
01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:13.368
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mm-hmm.</font>

1637
01:28:13.480 --> 01:28:15.050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told her I was fine,</font>

1638
01:28:15.160 --> 01:28:18.528
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I went and found her
later on at the coffee shop.</font>

1639
01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:21.007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And did Ms. Wesley refer you</font>

1640
01:28:21.120 --> 01:28:25.489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to any kind of
psychological counseling?</font>

1641
01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:27.523
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

1642
01:28:27.640 --> 01:28:30.325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did she suggest that perhaps</font>

1643
01:28:30.440 --> 01:28:31.566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">she wasn't the right person</font>

1644
01:28:31.680 --> 01:28:35.082
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to be discussing this
with you?</font>

1645
01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:36.884
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

1646
01:28:37.040 --> 01:28:39.088
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, then what
did Ms. Wesley do?</font>

1647
01:28:39.200 --> 01:28:41.009
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She was really nice.</font>

1648
01:28:41.120 --> 01:28:42.610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We talked for a long time</font>

1649
01:28:42.720 --> 01:28:46.008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I could tell
that she really cared.</font>

1650
01:28:46.120 --> 01:28:47.724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mm.</font>

1651
01:28:47.880 --> 01:28:49.848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I asked her how she
kept it all together so well,</font>

1652
01:28:49.960 --> 01:28:51.849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and she said, "Jesus."</font>

1653
01:28:51.960 --> 01:28:54.531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, she's the one
who brought up Jesus?</font>

1654
01:28:54.680 --> 01:28:56.762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did her endorsement
ofJesus</font>

1655
01:28:56.880 --> 01:28:59.360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">move you to explore
Christianity?</font>

1656
01:28:59.520 --> 01:29:01.204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, at first.</font>

1657
01:29:01.320 --> 01:29:06.690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But when the Salvation Army came
to pick up my brother's things,</font>

1658
01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:12.682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">one of the ladies found his
Bible, and she gave it to me.</font>

1659
01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:14.882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't even know
that he had one.</font>

1660
01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:16.445
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mm.</font>

1661
01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:20.007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, I started reading it,
and once I started,</font>

1662
01:29:20.120 --> 01:29:25.286
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I realized that
I didn't wanna stop.</font>

1663
01:29:25.400 --> 01:29:27.164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's why.</font>

1664
01:29:27.280 --> 01:29:30.921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's why I came up with the
question that I asked in class.</font>

1665
01:29:31.040 --> 01:29:33.611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, ifl understand
you correctly,</font>

1666
01:29:33.760 --> 01:29:37.128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">without Ms. Wesley's
direct involvement,</font>

1667
01:29:37.240 --> 01:29:39.641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you never would've asked that
question in the first place,</font>

1668
01:29:39.760 --> 01:29:41.683
<font face="Comic Sans MS">would you?</font>

1669
01:29:41.800 --> 01:29:43.325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know.</font>

1670
01:29:43.480 --> 01:29:47.007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">After all
of your Bible readings,</font>

1671
01:29:47.120 --> 01:29:52.843
<font face="Comic Sans MS">do you feel now
that you're a believer?</font>

1672
01:29:52.960 --> 01:29:54.849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

1673
01:29:54.960 --> 01:30:00.729
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe even a Christian?</font>

1674
01:30:00.840 --> 01:30:04.208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

1675
01:30:04.320 --> 01:30:06.402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At the risk
of seeming redundant,</font>

1676
01:30:06.520 --> 01:30:09.091
<font face="Comic Sans MS">do you think any of this,
the Bible readings,</font>

1677
01:30:09.200 --> 01:30:13.000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the question
about Jesus in class,</font>

1678
01:30:13.120 --> 01:30:15.691
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the newfound commitment
to Christianity,</font>

1679
01:30:15.800 --> 01:30:19.168
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is it likely that any of that
would've occurred</font>

1680
01:30:19.280 --> 01:30:24.286
<font face="Comic Sans MS">without Ms. Wesley's
direct involvement?</font>

1681
01:30:24.400 --> 01:30:28.724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, it wouldn't.</font>

1682
01:30:28.840 --> 01:30:32.287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thank you for your honesty.</font>

1683
01:30:32.400 --> 01:30:34.767
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No further questions,
Your Honor.</font>

1684
01:30:34.880 --> 01:30:38.202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Endler,
do you wish to redirect?</font>

1685
01:30:38.320 --> 01:30:40.766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, Your Honor.</font>

1686
01:30:40.880 --> 01:30:43.770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You may step down, Ms. Thawley.</font>

1687
01:30:45.240 --> 01:30:48.642
<font face="Comic Sans MS">N"?</font>

1688
01:30:56.680 --> 01:30:58.045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">N"?</font>

1689
01:30:58.160 --> 01:31:00.447
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why do they look so angry?</font>

1690
01:31:00.600 --> 01:31:02.409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because they think
we lied to them.</font>

1691
01:31:02.560 --> 01:31:05.848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But we didn't.</font>

1692
01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:08.531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It doesn't matter.</font>

1693
01:31:08.640 --> 01:31:10.722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This court is adjourned.</font>

1694
01:31:17.400 --> 01:31:20.165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have to prepare you, Grace.</font>

1695
01:31:20.280 --> 01:31:24.888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're gonna lose
this case.</font>

1696
01:31:25.040 --> 01:31:27.884
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know.</font>

1697
01:31:28.040 --> 01:31:30.168
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You were right.</font>

1698
01:31:30.280 --> 01:31:35.366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna lose everything.</font>

1699
01:31:53.520 --> 01:31:55.124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We saw
a very large crowd out here</font>

1700
01:31:55.280 --> 01:31:56.805
<font face="Comic Sans MS">at the courthouse yesterday,</font>

1701
01:31:56.920 --> 01:31:59.890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">both in protest and
support of teacher Grace Wesley,</font>

1702
01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:03.402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who is on trial for allegedly
proselytizing at the classroom.</font>

1703
01:32:03.520 --> 01:32:05.204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, in an unexpected
move yesterday,</font>

1704
01:32:05.320 --> 01:32:06.924
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we saw some of Wesley's
former students</font>

1705
01:32:07.080 --> 01:32:11.688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">come out to silently demonstrate
their support for their teacher.</font>

1706
01:32:25.240 --> 01:32:28.961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh Father, please
take this from me.</font>

1707
01:32:33.080 --> 01:32:38.484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know what to do.</font>

1708
01:32:38.600 --> 01:32:42.366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please don't forsake me.</font>

1709
01:32:42.480 --> 01:32:45.404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please.</font>

1710
01:32:56.040 --> 01:32:58.486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">N"?</font>

1711
01:33:06.040 --> 01:33:07.405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">N"?</font>

1712
01:33:11.800 --> 01:33:13.290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Brooke.</font>

1713
01:33:13.440 --> 01:33:15.681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I ruined everything, didn't I?</font>

1714
01:33:15.800 --> 01:33:18.167
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay,
you don't have to answer.</font>

1715
01:33:18.320 --> 01:33:20.800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know that I did.</font>

1716
01:33:20.920 --> 01:33:23.400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not even allowed
to talk to her.</font>

1717
01:33:23.520 --> 01:33:25.170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How do I let her know
that I'm sorry</font>

1718
01:33:25.280 --> 01:33:26.645
<font face="Comic Sans MS">without making things worse?</font>

1719
01:33:26.760 --> 01:33:28.922
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't tell you what to do,</font>

1720
01:33:29.080 --> 01:33:35.361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but whatever you do,
just let her know you care.</font>

1721
01:33:40.080 --> 01:33:41.730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Recently,
when I've been praying,</font>

1722
01:33:41.840 --> 01:33:44.411
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it's like Jesus isn't letting me
feel his presence.</font>

1723
01:33:44.520 --> 01:33:47.251
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Usually I can almost
reach out and touch him,</font>

1724
01:33:47.360 --> 01:33:55.484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but right now it's like
he's a million miles away.</font>

1725
01:33:55.600 --> 01:34:00.049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Honey, you of all people
should realize</font>

1726
01:34:00.160 --> 01:34:02.891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when you're going through
something really hard,</font>

1727
01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:08.325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the teacher is always quiet
during the test.</font>

1728
01:34:27.920 --> 01:34:32.642
<font face="Comic Sans MS"> Oh Lord my God </font>

1729
01:34:32.760 --> 01:34:38.563
<font face="Comic Sans MS"> When I in awesome wonder </font>

1730
01:34:38.680 --> 01:34:43.680
<font face="Comic Sans MS"> Consider all the worlds
thy hands have made </font>

1731
01:34:50.080 --> 01:34:54.802
<font face="Comic Sans MS"> I see the stars </font>

1732
01:34:54.920 --> 01:35:00.563
<font face="Comic Sans MS"> I hear the rolling thunder </font>

1733
01:35:00.680 --> 01:35:05.680
<font face="Comic Sans MS"> Thy power throughout
the universe displayed </font>

1734
01:35:11.880 --> 01:35:21.847
<font face="Comic Sans MS"> Then sings my soul,
my Savior God, to thee </font>

1735
01:35:23.160 --> 01:35:27.404
<font face="Comic Sans MS"> How great thou art </font>

1736
01:35:28.760 --> 01:35:34.324
<font face="Comic Sans MS"> How great thou art </font>

1737
01:35:34.440 --> 01:35:39.440
<font face="Comic Sans MS"> Then sings my soul,
my Savior God, to thee </font>

1738
01:35:45.800 --> 01:35:50.800
<font face="Comic Sans MS"> How great thou art </font>

1739
01:36:03.760 --> 01:36:04.841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">First of all,</font>

1740
01:36:04.960 --> 01:36:06.644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">this trial took
an unexpected turn</font>

1741
01:36:06.760 --> 01:36:09.411
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when Wesley's counsel
decided they'd try to prove</font>

1742
01:36:09.520 --> 01:36:12.126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the existence of Jesus.</font>

1743
01:36:12.240 --> 01:36:14.402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gary, this is kind of
your area of expertise.</font>

1744
01:36:14.520 --> 01:36:16.921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How do you convince
the skeptics?</font>

1745
01:36:17.080 --> 01:36:20.971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, Governor, I employ what
I call the minimal facts method,</font>

1746
01:36:21.080 --> 01:36:23.481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">which uses only
the historical events</font>

1747
01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:25.364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that are so well evidenced</font>

1748
01:36:25.480 --> 01:36:27.448
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that they're accepted
across the board,</font>

1749
01:36:27.560 --> 01:36:30.564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">even by skeptical
and non-Christian scholars.</font>

1750
01:36:30.720 --> 01:36:31.846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As a result, we--</font>

1751
01:36:31.960 --> 01:36:33.246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now I understand
what it is</font>

1752
01:36:33.360 --> 01:36:35.283
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you weren't allowed
to talk about.</font>

1753
01:36:35.400 --> 01:36:38.882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wish I still wasn't
allowed to talk about it.</font>

1754
01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She needs me on thatjury.</font>

1755
01:36:41.440 --> 01:36:42.885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have faith, David.</font>

1756
01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:44.923
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God's plan is at work.</font>

1757
01:36:45.040 --> 01:36:46.849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How'd you get here anyway?</font>

1758
01:36:46.960 --> 01:36:47.882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I borrowed your Prius.</font>

1759
01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:49.525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's very nice.</font>

1760
01:36:49.640 --> 01:36:50.641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't get too comfortable.</font>

1761
01:36:50.760 --> 01:36:52.728
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm planning a full recovery.</font>

1762
01:36:52.840 --> 01:36:54.251
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, Rice, do you believe</font>

1763
01:36:54.360 --> 01:36:55.566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that she was proselytizing
to her students?</font>

1764
01:36:55.680 --> 01:36:57.091
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Governor, not at all.</font>

1765
01:36:57.200 --> 01:36:59.441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jesus Christ was
the most influential person</font>

1766
01:36:59.560 --> 01:37:01.130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who ever lived.</font>

1767
01:37:01.240 --> 01:37:03.163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How could you ignore
that fact and teach history?</font>

1768
01:37:04.320 --> 01:37:05.651
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think the real problem is...</font>

1769
01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:07.410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Martin!</font>

1770
01:37:07.520 --> 01:37:08.885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">More questions?</font>

1771
01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:10.411
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wanted to make sure
that you were okay.</font>

1772
01:37:10.520 --> 01:37:12.124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I'm fine.</font>

1773
01:37:12.240 --> 01:37:14.004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're just holding me
over for a little observation.</font>

1774
01:37:14.120 --> 01:37:16.521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll be released soon.</font>

1775
01:37:16.680 --> 01:37:18.250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Something different
aboutyou.</font>

1776
01:37:18.360 --> 01:37:19.771
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you okay?</font>

1777
01:37:19.880 --> 01:37:21.484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I should say so.</font>

1778
01:37:21.600 --> 01:37:23.602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

1779
01:37:23.720 --> 01:37:25.484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I believe God wants me
to be a minister,</font>

1780
01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:27.728
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to return to my country
and become a pastor,</font>

1781
01:37:27.840 --> 01:37:29.080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">just like you.</font>

1782
01:37:29.200 --> 01:37:30.690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's great.</font>

1783
01:37:30.800 --> 01:37:32.928
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There'll be challenges
in your country.</font>

1784
01:37:33.040 --> 01:37:35.520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you prepared for them?</font>

1785
01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:38.968
<font face="Comic Sans MS">lam.</font>

1786
01:37:41.120 --> 01:37:42.531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm proud of you.</font>

1787
01:37:42.640 --> 01:37:44.051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come here.</font>

1788
01:37:47.360 --> 01:37:48.725
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's awesome.</font>

1789
01:37:48.880 --> 01:37:50.166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a shocking reality</font>

1790
01:37:50.280 --> 01:37:51.566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that Christians are soon
gonna be forced</font>

1791
01:37:51.680 --> 01:37:53.569
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to choose between
obeying the law of man</font>

1792
01:37:53.720 --> 01:37:55.927
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or following the Word of God.</font>

1793
01:37:56.040 --> 01:37:57.485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm Mike Huckabee.</font>

1794
01:37:57.640 --> 01:37:59.369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll see you next time
on "Point of View."</font>

1795
01:38:13.320 --> 01:38:15.800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">N"?</font>

1796
01:38:23.320 --> 01:38:25.687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">N"?</font>

1797
01:38:27.880 --> 01:38:29.291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey Brooke, why don't you
go be with Ms. Wesley.</font>

1798
01:38:29.400 --> 01:38:31.209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think we can handle this.</font>

1799
01:38:31.320 --> 01:38:33.209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, seriously,
we've got backup coming.</font>

1800
01:38:33.320 --> 01:38:36.164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're covered.</font>

1801
01:38:38.480 --> 01:38:40.084
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go get 'em.</font>

1802
01:38:44.800 --> 01:38:47.280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God's got this.</font>

1803
01:38:47.440 --> 01:38:50.046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">N"?</font>

1804
01:39:16.640 --> 01:39:18.927
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's Tom?</font>

1805
01:39:23.880 --> 01:39:26.884
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All rise.</font>

1806
01:39:33.720 --> 01:39:35.882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Be seated.</font>

1807
01:39:42.240 --> 01:39:43.651
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are we missing someone?</font>

1808
01:39:49.320 --> 01:39:50.970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry, Your Honor.</font>

1809
01:39:51.080 --> 01:39:52.923
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My apologies to the court.</font>

1810
01:39:57.320 --> 01:39:59.209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's unexpected.</font>

1811
01:39:59.320 --> 01:40:01.482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He almost looks
like a lawyer.</font>

1812
01:40:01.640 --> 01:40:06.123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your Honor, I have
one final witness to call.</font>

1813
01:40:06.240 --> 01:40:09.369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Grace Wesley.</font>

1814
01:40:09.520 --> 01:40:11.045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ms. Wesley, please</font>

1815
01:40:11.160 --> 01:40:13.481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">approach the witness stand.</font>

1816
01:40:13.600 --> 01:40:15.489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do I have to?</font>

1817
01:40:15.600 --> 01:40:17.568
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm afraid so.</font>

1818
01:40:22.200 --> 01:40:24.806
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your Honor, given the
witness's reluctance to testify,</font>

1819
01:40:24.920 --> 01:40:26.649
<font face="Comic Sans MS">can I have the court's
permission to treat her</font>

1820
01:40:26.760 --> 01:40:28.091
<font face="Comic Sans MS">as a hostile witness?</font>

1821
01:40:28.200 --> 01:40:32.524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You may.
Proceed at your own peril.</font>

1822
01:40:35.640 --> 01:40:37.768
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you swear to tell
the truth, the whole truth,</font>

1823
01:40:37.880 --> 01:40:38.961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and nothing but the truth?</font>

1824
01:40:39.080 --> 01:40:40.161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I do.</font>

1825
01:40:40.280 --> 01:40:41.691
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please be seated.</font>

1826
01:40:47.200 --> 01:40:49.487
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Grace, I want you
to do something for me,</font>

1827
01:40:49.600 --> 01:40:52.285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">something for everyone
in this courtroom.</font>

1828
01:40:52.440 --> 01:40:54.522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want you to apologize.</font>

1829
01:40:54.640 --> 01:40:57.405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want you to say you're sorry
and that you made a mistake.</font>

1830
01:40:57.520 --> 01:40:58.726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your Honor,
what's going on here?</font>

1831
01:40:58.840 --> 01:41:01.241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do it, Grace.</font>

1832
01:41:01.360 --> 01:41:02.850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't do that.</font>

1833
01:41:02.960 --> 01:41:04.883
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why? Why can't you
do that, Grace?</font>

1834
01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because I don't believe
I did anything wrong.</font>

1835
01:41:07.640 --> 01:41:11.167
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, as your attorney, I'm
advising you to do it anyway.</font>

1836
01:41:11.280 --> 01:41:13.009
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To at least pretend
that you're sorry</font>

1837
01:41:13.120 --> 01:41:15.407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and throw yourself
on the mercy of the court.</font>

1838
01:41:15.520 --> 01:41:16.567
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

1839
01:41:16.680 --> 01:41:18.091
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That would be a lie.</font>

1840
01:41:18.200 --> 01:41:19.486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So what?</font>

1841
01:41:19.600 --> 01:41:20.965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everyone lies.</font>

1842
01:41:21.080 --> 01:41:22.491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not everyone.</font>

1843
01:41:22.600 --> 01:41:25.080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you looking
to become a martyr?</font>

1844
01:41:25.200 --> 01:41:27.043
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What in the world
is he doing?</font>

1845
01:41:27.160 --> 01:41:28.730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have no idea.</font>

1846
01:41:28.840 --> 01:41:29.727
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

1847
01:41:29.840 --> 01:41:31.205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tommy...</font>

1848
01:41:31.320 --> 01:41:33.049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then what is it
that you want, Grace?</font>

1849
01:41:33.160 --> 01:41:36.369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell me. Tell us.</font>

1850
01:41:36.480 --> 01:41:37.845
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want--</font>

1851
01:41:39.920 --> 01:41:42.890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want to be able
to tell the truth.</font>

1852
01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The truth?</font>

1853
01:41:45.560 --> 01:41:46.891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whose truth?</font>

1854
01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:50.527
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And what truth
are you referring to?</font>

1855
01:41:50.640 --> 01:41:55.407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Grace, is there some truth that
you know that no one else knows?</font>

1856
01:41:57.520 --> 01:41:58.885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, that's right.</font>

1857
01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:00.570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The other night,</font>

1858
01:42:00.680 --> 01:42:04.241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">didn't you tell me that Jesus
spoke to you personally?</font>

1859
01:42:04.360 --> 01:42:05.850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why are you doing this?</font>

1860
01:42:05.960 --> 01:42:07.450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm the one asking
the questions, Ms. Wesley.</font>

1861
01:42:07.600 --> 01:42:09.090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you
or did you not tell me</font>

1862
01:42:09.200 --> 01:42:13.250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that Jesus spoke to you
personally?</font>

1863
01:42:13.360 --> 01:42:15.806
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

1864
01:42:15.920 --> 01:42:18.207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And what did he say?</font>

1865
01:42:18.360 --> 01:42:20.089
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll make it easier for you.</font>

1866
01:42:20.200 --> 01:42:22.806
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Didn't you say that he
asked you a question?</font>

1867
01:42:22.920 --> 01:42:24.570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was personal.
You weren't supposed to--</font>

1868
01:42:24.680 --> 01:42:26.330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't care.</font>

1869
01:42:26.440 --> 01:42:28.522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The other night, you told me
that Jesus asked you something.</font>

1870
01:42:28.640 --> 01:42:30.290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What did he ask you, Grace?</font>

1871
01:42:30.400 --> 01:42:31.811
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell all of us.</font>

1872
01:42:31.920 --> 01:42:33.331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think we deserve to know.</font>

1873
01:42:33.440 --> 01:42:35.044
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why are you
doing this to me?</font>

1874
01:42:35.160 --> 01:42:36.525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Answer the question.</font>

1875
01:42:36.640 --> 01:42:38.210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They won't believe me.</font>

1876
01:42:38.320 --> 01:42:40.243
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Doesn't matter.</font>

1877
01:42:40.360 --> 01:42:45.446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All that matters
is that you believe it.</font>

1878
01:42:45.560 --> 01:42:48.723
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell us, Grace,
under penalty of perjury,</font>

1879
01:42:48.840 --> 01:42:51.764
<font face="Comic Sans MS">what was the question that God
presented to you personally</font>

1880
01:42:51.880 --> 01:42:55.327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that night on campus?</font>

1881
01:42:55.480 --> 01:42:57.801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Answer the question.</font>

1882
01:42:59.920 --> 01:43:02.082
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Answer the question!</font>

1883
01:43:08.600 --> 01:43:15.290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He asked,
"Who do you say that I am?"</font>

1884
01:43:17.400 --> 01:43:21.962
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And what did you answer?</font>

1885
01:43:22.080 --> 01:43:27.246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are the Christ,
the Son of the living God.</font>

1886
01:43:31.200 --> 01:43:33.885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, there you have it.</font>

1887
01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your Honor, I think we've
all heard quite enough.</font>

1888
01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:38.445
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Endler,</font>

1889
01:43:38.560 --> 01:43:40.881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">are you looking
to change your client's plea?</font>

1890
01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:42.809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, Your Honor.</font>

1891
01:43:42.920 --> 01:43:45.048
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I say she's innocent
of all wrongdoing.</font>

1892
01:43:45.160 --> 01:43:48.403
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I'm asking the jury
to find against her anyway.</font>

1893
01:43:48.520 --> 01:43:50.204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, let's, let's face it.</font>

1894
01:43:50.320 --> 01:43:54.291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She has the audacity to believe
not only that there is a God,</font>

1895
01:43:54.400 --> 01:43:56.801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but that she has a personal
relationship with Him,</font>

1896
01:43:56.920 --> 01:44:00.367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">which colors everything
that she says and does.</font>

1897
01:44:00.480 --> 01:44:02.005
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think it's time
that we stop pretending</font>

1898
01:44:02.120 --> 01:44:04.168
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that we can trust
a person like this</font>

1899
01:44:04.280 --> 01:44:06.328
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to serve in a public capacity.</font>

1900
01:44:06.440 --> 01:44:09.922
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In the name of tolerance and
diversity, I say we destroy her.</font>

1901
01:44:10.040 --> 01:44:11.326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's enough, Mr. Endler.</font>

1902
01:44:11.440 --> 01:44:13.169
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then we can all go
to our graves content,</font>

1903
01:44:13.280 --> 01:44:15.328
<font face="Comic Sans MS">knowing that we stomped out
the last spark of faith</font>

1904
01:44:15.440 --> 01:44:16.851
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that was ever exhibited
in the public square.</font>

1905
01:44:18.320 --> 01:44:19.606
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's enough, Mr. Endler.</font>

1906
01:44:19.720 --> 01:44:20.687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I say we make
an example of her.</font>

1907
01:44:20.800 --> 01:44:22.609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Endler, that's enough.</font>

1908
01:44:22.720 --> 01:44:24.210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's set a new precedent,</font>

1909
01:44:24.360 --> 01:44:26.966
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that employment by our
federal government mandates</font>

1910
01:44:27.080 --> 01:44:29.731
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that you must first denounce
any belief system you have.</font>

1911
01:44:29.840 --> 01:44:31.524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Endler that is enough!
You are out of order.</font>

1912
01:44:31.640 --> 01:44:33.369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And if someone slips
through the cracks</font>

1913
01:44:33.480 --> 01:44:37.769
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and hides their beliefs, then
we arrest them and fine them.</font>

1914
01:44:37.880 --> 01:44:39.769
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And if they don't pay,
then we seize their property.</font>

1915
01:44:39.880 --> 01:44:41.211
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And if they resist--</font>

1916
01:44:42.680 --> 01:44:44.045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, let's not kid ourselves.</font>

1917
01:44:44.160 --> 01:44:46.003
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Enforcement is always
at the end of a gun.</font>

1918
01:44:46.120 --> 01:44:47.884
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Endler,
you are out of order.</font>

1919
01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:49.331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I charge you with contempt!</font>

1920
01:44:49.440 --> 01:44:51.090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I accept the charge,</font>

1921
01:44:51.200 --> 01:44:53.771
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because I have nothing but
contempt for these proceedings.</font>

1922
01:44:53.880 --> 01:44:56.770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If we're going to insist that
a Christian's right to believe</font>

1923
01:44:56.880 --> 01:44:58.689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is subordinate
to all other rights,</font>

1924
01:44:58.800 --> 01:45:00.962
<font face="Comic Sans MS">then it's not a right.</font>

1925
01:45:01.080 --> 01:45:03.686
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Somebody is always
going to be offended.</font>

1926
01:45:03.800 --> 01:45:06.690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Two thousand years of
human history proves that.</font>

1927
01:45:06.800 --> 01:45:08.484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, I say we get on with it.</font>

1928
01:45:08.600 --> 01:45:11.922
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cite the law, charge the jury,
and send them off to deliberate.</font>

1929
01:45:12.040 --> 01:45:14.008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So be it!</font>

1930
01:45:17.880 --> 01:45:21.441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, we are gonna bypass
the usual closing arguments,</font>

1931
01:45:21.560 --> 01:45:24.962
<font face="Comic Sans MS">unless Mr. Kane finds the need
to further address the jury.</font>

1932
01:45:25.080 --> 01:45:26.969
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, Your Honor.</font>

1933
01:45:27.080 --> 01:45:29.367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can ask nothing more.</font>

1934
01:45:29.480 --> 01:45:33.371
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My instructions
to you are simple.</font>

1935
01:45:33.480 --> 01:45:37.804
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uphold the law without unfairly
prejudicing your decision</font>

1936
01:45:37.920 --> 01:45:42.528
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or risking a mistrial on appeal.</font>

1937
01:45:42.640 --> 01:45:48.522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, I believe I can safely say
that the respondent's counsel</font>

1938
01:45:48.640 --> 01:45:53.726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">has dared you to convict
his own client.</font>

1939
01:45:57.680 --> 01:46:01.480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The jury will now be
dismissed for deliberation.</font>

1940
01:46:01.600 --> 01:46:04.729
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We are adjourned.</font>

1941
01:46:11.080 --> 01:46:13.401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She hasn't got a prayer.</font>

1942
01:46:13.520 --> 01:46:14.851
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go.</font>

1943
01:46:18.200 --> 01:46:20.931
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Remind me to send him
a thank-you note.</font>

1944
01:46:35.880 --> 01:46:38.770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">N"?</font>

1945
01:46:45.920 --> 01:46:48.287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">N"?</font>

1946
01:46:55.920 --> 01:46:57.968
<font face="Comic Sans MS">N"?</font>

1947
01:47:05.920 --> 01:47:08.321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">N"?</font>

1948
01:47:26.480 --> 01:47:28.289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you so much.
Thank you, guys.</font>

1949
01:47:28.400 --> 01:47:29.731
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks for coming out.</font>

1950
01:47:29.880 --> 01:47:31.769
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, right now on the phone,</font>

1951
01:47:31.920 --> 01:47:33.922
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a friend of mine named Amy
is on the line,</font>

1952
01:47:34.040 --> 01:47:38.602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and she's calling about a woman
who's on trial for her faith.</font>

1953
01:47:38.760 --> 01:47:43.163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This woman has risked
everything for Jesus.</font>

1954
01:47:43.280 --> 01:47:45.851
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Amy's asked me to pray
for this woman.</font>

1955
01:47:45.960 --> 01:47:47.928
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Will you guys join me?</font>

1956
01:47:48.040 --> 01:47:51.203
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lord, we know that
to risk anything for you</font>

1957
01:47:51.360 --> 01:47:55.490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is a complete honor
with eternal rewards.</font>

1958
01:47:55.600 --> 01:47:57.568
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But if it's within your will,</font>

1959
01:47:57.680 --> 01:48:01.810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">can you please restore
this woman's hope</font>

1960
01:48:01.920 --> 01:48:07.131
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and make her faith
an example to all of us?</font>

1961
01:48:07.240 --> 01:48:10.369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lord, show your power
to a fallen world.</font>

1962
01:48:10.480 --> 01:48:15.327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We know you have the power
to do anything.</font>

1963
01:48:15.440 --> 01:48:19.331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, we ask you right now, crying
out as the body of Christ,</font>

1964
01:48:19.440 --> 01:48:21.249
<font face="Comic Sans MS">move those hearts
of those people,</font>

1965
01:48:21.360 --> 01:48:23.328
<font face="Comic Sans MS">both the judge and the jury,</font>

1966
01:48:23.440 --> 01:48:27.843
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to let them know the
beauty of your majesty.</font>

1967
01:48:27.960 --> 01:48:31.851
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And we all said amen.</font>

1968
01:48:31.960 --> 01:48:33.200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Amen.</font>

1969
01:48:40.080 --> 01:48:42.321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">N"?</font>

1970
01:48:50.120 --> 01:48:52.441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">N"?</font>

1971
01:49:00.120 --> 01:49:02.202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">N"?</font>

1972
01:49:04.600 --> 01:49:06.170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ladies
and gentlemen of the jury,</font>

1973
01:49:06.280 --> 01:49:08.248
<font face="Comic Sans MS">have you reached a decision?</font>

1974
01:49:09.680 --> 01:49:11.648
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have, Your Honor.</font>

1975
01:49:16.080 --> 01:49:18.970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And how do you find?</font>

1976
01:49:24.480 --> 01:49:30.249
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We, the jury, find in favor
of Grace Wesley.</font>

1977
01:49:34.080 --> 01:49:39.080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">N"?</font>

1978
01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:50.520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We are adjourned.</font>

1979
01:50:01.680 --> 01:50:03.489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nice shoes.</font>

1980
01:50:03.600 --> 01:50:06.888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">N"?</font>

1981
01:50:13.600 --> 01:50:16.365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">N"?</font>

1982
01:50:23.600 --> 01:50:24.965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">N"?</font>

1983
01:50:25.080 --> 01:50:28.641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Grace, I'm sorry.</font>

1984
01:50:28.760 --> 01:50:29.807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I couldn't tell you.</font>

1985
01:50:29.920 --> 01:50:31.684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It had to come
as a surprise,</font>

1986
01:50:31.800 --> 01:50:34.485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">otherwise the jury wouldn't have
been swayed by your reactions.</font>

1987
01:50:34.600 --> 01:50:38.400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, you did have a plan.</font>

1988
01:50:38.520 --> 01:50:41.967
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, you did.</font>

1989
01:50:42.080 --> 01:50:43.650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You stood up
for what you believed in</font>

1990
01:50:43.760 --> 01:50:45.683
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you held on
to your faith.</font>

1991
01:50:45.800 --> 01:50:48.963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know anybody
that would have done that.</font>

1992
01:50:49.120 --> 01:50:51.726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They were hoping to
make an example of you,</font>

1993
01:50:51.840 --> 01:50:57.961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but instead you became
an inspiration.</font>

1994
01:50:58.080 --> 01:51:00.048
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We did it!</font>

1995
01:51:00.160 --> 01:51:03.243
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, you've kept
quiet long enough.</font>

1996
01:51:03.360 --> 01:51:06.762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why don't you go
share the good news?</font>

1997
01:51:09.520 --> 01:51:15.004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, thank you.</font>

1998
01:51:15.120 --> 01:51:17.441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

1999
01:51:18.440 --> 01:51:21.762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">N"?</font>

2000
01:51:26.440 --> 01:51:29.569
<font face="Comic Sans MS"> When did it become
breaking a rule </font>

2001
01:51:29.680 --> 01:51:33.321
<font face="Comic Sans MS"> To say your name out
loud in school </font>

2002
01:51:33.440 --> 01:51:40.483
<font face="Comic Sans MS"> When your name's the only one
that sets us free </font>

2003
01:51:40.600 --> 01:51:44.047
<font face="Comic Sans MS"> When did it become incorrect </font>

2004
01:51:44.160 --> 01:51:47.846
<font face="Comic Sans MS"> To speak the truth
about life and death </font>

2005
01:51:47.960 --> 01:51:54.047
<font face="Comic Sans MS"> When your life
gave us all eternity </font>

2006
01:51:54.160 --> 01:51:57.607
<font face="Comic Sans MS"> Even if it gets me convicted </font>

2007
01:51:57.720 --> 01:52:02.567
<font face="Comic Sans MS"> I'll be on my knees
with my hands lifted </font>

2008
01:52:02.680 --> 01:52:04.170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God's not dead!</font>

2009
01:52:04.320 --> 01:52:06.527
<font face="Comic Sans MS"> If serving you's
against the law of man </font>

2010
01:52:06.640 --> 01:52:11.601
<font face="Comic Sans MS"> If living out my faith
in you is banned </font>

2011
01:52:11.720 --> 01:52:17.602
<font face="Comic Sans MS"> Then I'll stand
right before the jury </font>

2012
01:52:17.720 --> 01:52:21.042
<font face="Comic Sans MS"> If saying I believe
is out of line </font>

2013
01:52:21.160 --> 01:52:26.246
<font face="Comic Sans MS"> If it's just cause
I'm gonna give my life </font>

2014
01:52:26.360 --> 01:52:31.844
<font face="Comic Sans MS"> To show the world
the love that fills me </font>

2015
01:52:31.960 --> 01:52:33.769
<font face="Comic Sans MS"> Then I want to be guilty </font>

2016
01:52:33.880 --> 01:52:35.882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A case
that was turning for the worse</font>

2017
01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:37.764
<font face="Comic Sans MS">was concluded with
a powerful happy ending</font>

2018
01:52:37.880 --> 01:52:39.450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for Ms. Grace Wesley.</font>

2019
01:52:39.560 --> 01:52:41.528
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Live outside the courthouse
here in Hope Springs.</font>

2020
01:52:41.640 --> 01:52:43.085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Father. You did it!</font>

2021
01:52:43.200 --> 01:52:45.328
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ha ha ha ha ha!</font>

2022
01:52:45.440 --> 01:52:47.681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God is good.</font>

2023
01:52:47.800 --> 01:52:49.131
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The verdict is in.</font>

2024
01:52:49.280 --> 01:52:50.486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.
I want to hear this.</font>

2025
01:52:50.600 --> 01:52:51.886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In the case
of Thawley V. Wesley,</font>

2026
01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:53.889
<font face="Comic Sans MS">they have ruled in favor
of Grace Wesley.</font>

2027
01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The crowd is in full celebration
here in Hope Springs.</font>

2028
01:52:57.040 --> 01:53:00.249
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So are you gonna
say it, or should I?</font>

2029
01:53:00.360 --> 01:53:01.805
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Say what?</font>

2030
01:53:01.960 --> 01:53:03.564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God is good.</font>

2031
01:53:03.680 --> 01:53:05.205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All the time.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">God is good.</font>

2034
01:53:08.200 --> 01:53:09.440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Amen, brother.</font>

01:53:09.560 --> 01:53:11.927
<font face="Comic Sans MS">N"?</font>

2036
01:53:12.040 --> 01:53:15.840
<font face="Comic Sans MS"> Show the world
the love that fills me </font>

2037

<font face="Comic Sans MS"> Love that fills me </font>

2038
01:53:17.600 --> 01:53:21.685
<font face="Comic Sans MS"> Then I want to be guilty
by association </font>

2039
01:53:21.800 --> 01:53:26.601
<font face="Comic Sans MS"> Guilty of being a voice
proclaiming your ways </font>

2040
01:53:26.720 --> 01:53:28.927
<font face="Comic Sans MS"> Your truth, your life </font>

2041
01:53:29.040 --> 01:53:35.207
<font face="Comic Sans MS"> I'll pay the price
to be your light </font>

2042
01:53:37.720 --> 01:53:39.051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll get to work
on the appeal.</font>

2043
01:53:39.160 --> 01:53:40.650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't bother.</font>

2044
01:53:40.760 --> 01:53:42.728
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If we appeal and lose,
it'll set a precedent.</font>

2045
01:53:42.840 --> 01:53:44.444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't want that.</font>

2046
01:53:44.560 --> 01:53:45.971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't understand
how we lost this.</font>

2047
01:53:46.080 --> 01:53:47.366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He outsmarted us.</font>

2048
01:53:47.480 --> 01:53:50.927
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He played our role
in attacking Wesley.</font>

2049
01:53:51.040 --> 01:53:53.441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He made the jury
hate everyone, but her.</font>

2050
01:53:53.560 --> 01:53:58.122
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not to mention he proved
the existence of Jesus Christ.</font>

2051
01:54:12.520 --> 01:54:15.364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God's not dead! He's surely

<font face="Comic Sans MS"> He's roaring... </font>

2064
01:54:51.960 --> 01:54:56.204
<font face="Comic Sans MS"> He's roaring like a lion </font>

2065
01:54:56.320 --> 01:55:03.568
<font face="Comic Sans MS"> Let hope arise
and make the darkness hide </font>

2066
01:55:03.680 --> 01:55:12.202
<font face="Comic Sans MS"> My faith is dead,
I need a resurrection somehow </font>

2067
01:55:12.320 --> 01:55:19.283
<font face="Comic Sans MS"> Now I'm lost in your freedom </font>

2068
