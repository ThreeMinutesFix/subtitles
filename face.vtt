00:58.090 --> 00:59.190
CROSS BLOCK 30! 

00:59.220 --> 01:01.020
CROSS BLOCK 30! 

01:01.050 --> 01:03.020
READY? 

01:03.050 --> 01:05.010
 THE EAGLES WILL HAVE TO  GO FOR IT ON FOURTH DOWN 

01:05.040 --> 01:07.230
WITH JUST 42 SECONDS LEFT IN THE FOOTBALL GAME AND NO TIME OUTS. 

01:07.260 --> 01:10.030
 COACH GRANT TAYLOR CAN GET  HIS FIRST WINNING SEASON FOR 

01:10.060 --> 01:13.270
THE SHILOH CHRISTIAN ACADEMY IF THEY CAN PULL THIS PLAY OFF. 

01:14.000 --> 01:15.220
BLUE 18! 

01:15.250 --> 01:17.050
SET, HUT! 

01:17.080 --> 01:18.170
ZACH AVERY WILL TAKE THE SNAP. 

01:18.200 --> 01:21.020
HE PITCHES BACK TO JACOB HALL, JACOB'S GONNA TRY TO PASS IT. 

01:21.050 --> 01:23.070
HE'S GOT JEREMY JOHNSON GOING DOWN THE FIELD. 

01:23.100 --> 01:24.190
BUT HERE COME THE TIGERS. 

01:24.220 --> 01:25.240
THROW IT, JACOB! 

01:25.270 --> 01:27.040
 JACOB'S GONNA TRY  TO TUCK IT AND RUN, 

01:27.070 --> 01:29.190
 AND HE'S GONNA BE TAKEN  DOWN AT THE 40-YARD LINE, 

01:29.220 --> 01:31.070
 STOPPED THERE BY  LEWIS SLAUGHTER. 

01:31.100 --> 01:33.120
 JEREMY JOHNSON WAS WIDE  OPEN DOWN THE FIELD. 

01:33.150 --> 01:35.290
 IF HE'D ONLY HAD A FEW SECONDS  MORE TO THROW THE FOOTBALL, 

01:36.020 --> 01:38.030
 THIS GAME MIGHT HAVE  HAD A DIFFERENT OUTCOME. 

01:38.060 --> 01:41.040
 AS IT IS, THE TIGERS WILL TAKE  OVER NOW AND WILL NO DOUBT 

01:41.070 --> 01:42.270
TAKE A KNEE TO RUN OUT THE CLOCK. 

01:43.000 --> 01:45.010
 THUS ENDING COACH GRANT  TAYLOR'S BID FOR HIS FIRST 

01:45.040 --> 01:47.020
 WINNING SEASON IN 6 YEARS. 

01:47.050 --> 01:49.150
 NOW HE'LL HAVE TO WAIT  UNTIL NEXT SEASON FOR THAT 

01:49.180 --> 01:52.030
 ALL ELUSIVE WINNING RECORD. 

01:52.060 --> 01:55.000
THAT'S IF THEY LET HIM COME BACK NEXT YEAR. 

02:02.270 --> 02:09.020
 

04:02.230 --> 04:05.010
 

04:05.040 --> 04:06.190
COME ON, EVERYBODY. 

04:06.220 --> 04:07.240
GET 'EM CLAIR. 

04:07.270 --> 04:09.000
HEY, GRANT. 

04:09.030 --> 04:10.050
COME ON, YA'LL, QUIT TALKING. 

04:10.080 --> 04:13.030
LET'S GO, LET'S GO, LET'S GO, HURRY. 

04:20.260 --> 04:24.100
 WHAT? 

04:28.190 --> 04:30.130
 WHAT? 

04:30.160 --> 04:33.230
YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME. 

04:33.260 --> 04:35.080
THIS BETTER BE A JOKE. 

04:35.110 --> 04:36.160
NOPE. 

04:36.170 --> 04:40.010
MANDY SAID HE CAME IN THIS MORNING AND GOT HIS PAPERS. 

04:40.040 --> 04:42.110
WAIT, A PLAYER JUST CAN'T TRANSFER TO ANOTHER SCHOOL 

04:42.140 --> 04:43.140
TO PLAY FOOTBALL. 

04:43.170 --> 04:44.180
HE'S GOTTA MAKE A CHANGE OF ADDRESS. 

04:44.210 --> 04:45.180
HE DID. 

04:45.210 --> 04:48.210
HE'S MOVING IN WITH HIS DAD. 

04:57.170 --> 05:00.080
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT. 

05:00.110 --> 05:03.000
THIS IS THE THIRD TIME THIS HAS HAPPENED. 

05:03.030 --> 05:05.040
SPEND 3 YEARS POURIN' INTO THEM AND WHAT DO THEY DO WHEN THEY 

05:05.070 --> 05:06.070
 GET TO THEIR SENIOR YEAR? 

05:06.100 --> 05:08.010
THEY TRANSFER TO A RIVAL SCHOOL. 

05:08.040 --> 05:09.240
WHY? 

05:09.270 --> 05:12.010
WELL, 'CAUSE AT THE END OF THE SEASON, 

05:12.040 --> 05:13.190
NOBODY WANTS TO BE ON TV GOIN', 

05:13.220 --> 05:18.000
"WIN NUMBER SIX, BABY, WIN NUMBER SIX." 

05:18.030 --> 05:21.000
WELL, YOU ASKED. 

05:23.290 --> 05:26.220
JUST HAD TO GO THERE, DIDN'T YOU? 

05:29.060 --> 05:30.250
COACH, IS IT TRUE DARREN SWITCHED TO TUCKER? 

05:30.280 --> 05:32.110
WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT IN A MINUTE, BROCK. 

05:32.140 --> 05:33.110
SO IT'S TRUE. 

05:33.140 --> 05:34.210
WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT IN A MINUTE. 

05:34.240 --> 05:36.060
HUDDLE UP! 

05:36.090 --> 05:41.000
COACH, IS IT TRUE THAT DARREN TRANSFERRED TO TUCKER? 

05:42.280 --> 05:45.140
I GOT WORD THIS MORNING THAT DARREN DID TRANSFER TO TUCKER. 

05:45.170 --> 05:47.020
AW! 

05:47.050 --> 05:48.120
THERE GOES THE SEASON. 

05:48.150 --> 05:49.200
THE SEASON HASN'T STARTED, AND WILL BE 

05:49.230 --> 05:50.200
WHATEVER WE MAKE IT. 

05:50.230 --> 05:51.200
WHO'S GONNA TAKE THIS PLACE? 

05:51.230 --> 05:53.090
HE SCORED A THIRD OF OUR POINTS LAST YEAR. 

05:53.120 --> 05:54.200
YOU LET ME WORRY ABOUT THAT. 

05:54.230 --> 05:56.220
WE'RE NOT STARTING OFF THE SEASON AS IF IT'S DOOM'S DAY. 

05:56.250 --> 05:58.040
NOBODY'S IRREPLACEABLE. 

05:58.070 --> 05:59.160
DARREN IS. 

05:59.190 --> 06:00.280
DARREN IS NOT. 

06:00.290 --> 06:02.210
THERE'S MORE TO A GOOD FOOTBALL TEAM THAN A RUNNING BACK. 

06:02.240 --> 06:04.270
 IF ANYTHING, THIS OUGHT TO  PUSH YOU TO TAKE UP THE SLACK. 

06:05.000 --> 06:06.200
STOP WORRYING ABOUT DARREN. 

06:06.230 --> 06:08.120
GET OUT THERE AND START YOUR DRILLS. 

06:08.150 --> 06:09.230
WE GOT A GAME TO PLAY THIS FRIDAY NIGHT. 

06:09.260 --> 06:10.280
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO SHILOH! 

06:11.010 --> 06:11.280
COME ON! 

06:12.010 --> 06:14.030
LET'S GO! 

06:16.230 --> 06:21.230
 

06:39.070 --> 06:41.140
WHY'D YOU PARK ALL THE WAY OUT THERE? 

06:41.170 --> 06:43.270
HAD TO, IT DIED AGAIN. 

06:44.000 --> 06:45.210
WHY DON'T WE GET A NEW BATTERY? 

06:45.240 --> 06:47.230
I'LL GET BRADY TO HELP ME TOMORROW MORNING. 

06:47.260 --> 06:49.150
I DON'T EVEN WANT TO THINK ABOUT IT NOW. 

06:49.180 --> 06:51.060
DO YOU WANT ME TO TAKE A LOOK AT IT FOR YA? 

06:51.090 --> 06:53.020
STOP IT. 

06:55.250 --> 06:56.290
OH, SWEETHEART-- 

06:57.020 --> 06:58.200
GRANT, I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT SMELL IS. 

06:58.230 --> 07:00.170
I SCRUBBED EVERYTHING I CAN. 

07:00.200 --> 07:01.240
IT'S TERRIBLE. 

07:01.270 --> 07:03.240
I KNOW IT IS, BUT WHAT ELSE CAN I DO? 

07:03.270 --> 07:05.190
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE IT'S COMING FROM. 

07:05.220 --> 07:08.120
THIS DAY STUNK, WHY SHOULDN'T MY HOUSE? 

07:08.150 --> 07:09.200
WHAT DO YOU MEAN? 

07:09.230 --> 07:11.160
DARREN TRANSFERRED TO TUCKER. 

07:11.190 --> 07:12.270
WHAT? 

07:13.000 --> 07:14.060
HE DID NOT. 

07:14.090 --> 07:15.270
YEP, CAME BY AND GOT HIS PAPERS. 

07:16.000 --> 07:17.140
DIDN'T EVEN SAY GOOD-BYE. 

07:17.170 --> 07:18.250
WHY? 

07:18.280 --> 07:19.280
WHY DO YOU THINK? 

07:20.010 --> 07:22.030
DOESN'T SEE A CHANCE OF WINNING AT SHILOH. 

07:22.060 --> 07:25.100
BUT IT AIN'T LIKE TUCKER'S GONNA GUARANTEE HIM A SCHOLARSHIP. 

07:25.130 --> 07:28.000
OOH, I BET THE BOYS ARE FRUSTRATED. 

07:28.030 --> 07:30.050
MORE THAN YOU KNOW. 

07:46.000 --> 07:48.260
I MEANT TO THROW THAT AWAY. 

07:48.290 --> 07:51.180
DID YOU THINK YOU WERE PREGNANT? 

07:51.210 --> 07:53.030
I DON'T KNOW. 

07:53.060 --> 07:54.230
I JUST WANT TO BE PREGNANT SO BAD 

07:54.260 --> 07:57.260
THAT MY MIND PLAYS TRICKS ON ME. 

08:08.040 --> 08:12.260
 YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN 4 YEARS  SINCE WE STARTED TRYING. 

08:12.290 --> 08:17.210
WOULD YOU BE OPPOSED TO ME GOING TO SEE A SPECIALIST? 

08:17.240 --> 08:19.020
NO. 

08:19.050 --> 08:23.100
I'D JUST LIKE TO KNOW WHAT SHE SAYS. 

08:23.130 --> 08:27.100
OKAY. 

08:27.130 --> 08:29.160
I THOUGHT WE WERE HAVING SPAGHETTI TONIGHT. 

08:29.190 --> 08:31.270
THE STOVE'S NOT WORKING. 

08:32.000 --> 08:35.070
YOU'RE KIDDING ME. 

08:35.100 --> 08:37.120
SO, WE GOT A LEAK IN THE BACK ROOM? 

08:37.150 --> 08:38.290
THE DRYER ONLY WORKS HALF THE TIME? 

08:39.020 --> 08:43.050
THE CAR IS DYING ON US AND NOW THE STOVE'S BROKEN? 

08:43.080 --> 08:44.280
THAT'S ABOUT RIGHT. 

08:45.010 --> 08:48.200
NO WONDER I'M LOSING MY HAIR. 

08:48.230 --> 08:51.290
I LOVE YOU. 

08:55.280 --> 08:57.280
 

08:58.140 --> 09:03.040
 AND NOW YOUR GEORGIA SPORTS  BREAK WITH ALICIA HOUSTON. 

09:04.000 --> 09:05.230
THE RICHLAND GIANTS HAVE STARTED FOOTBALL PRACTICE 

09:05.260 --> 09:07.240
AS THE NEW SCHOOL YEAR GETS UNDERWAY. 

09:07.270 --> 09:09.040
THE TEAM WILL BE DEFENDING 

09:09.070 --> 09:11.200
A 3-YEAR G.I.S.A. STATE CHAMPIONSHIP RUN. 

09:11.230 --> 09:13.230
NOW THEY PREPARE TO FIGHT FOR A FOURTH. 

09:13.260 --> 09:16.220
I'M HERE WITH HEAD COACH BOBBY LEE DUKE OF THE GIANTS. 

09:16.250 --> 09:19.100
COACH DUKE, HOW DOES THIS YEAR LOOK FOR THE TEAM? 

09:19.130 --> 09:23.040
ALICE, WE'VE GROWN REAL FOUND OF THE STATE TITLE, 

09:23.070 --> 09:25.210
AND WE DON'T SEE ANY REASON TO GIVE IT UP THIS YEAR. 

09:25.240 --> 09:27.220
I'VE GOT MOST OF MY STARTERS COMING BACK, 

09:27.250 --> 09:29.170
AND I'VE GOT A STRONG BENCH. 

09:29.200 --> 09:31.210
SO I'VE ONLY GOT ONE THING TO SAY, 

09:31.240 --> 09:35.270
GET OFF THE TRACKS 'CAUSE THE FREIGHT TRAIN'S COMIN'. 

09:37.140 --> 09:42.150
 

10:34.220 --> 10:36.110
[WHISTLE BLOWS] 

11:02.000 --> 11:03.270
I HOPE THAT'S NOT A SIGN OF THE WAY THE REST 

11:04.000 --> 11:06.070
OF THE SEASON'S GONNA GO, COACH. 

11:06.100 --> 11:08.030
NOW WHY HE'D HAVE TO SAY THAT? 

11:08.060 --> 11:09.210
JUST LET IT GO. 

11:09.240 --> 11:11.030
I HATE THIS CAR. 

11:11.060 --> 11:12.110
LET'S FIND SOMEBODY WITH JUMPER CABLES, 

11:12.140 --> 11:13.290
AND LET'S GO HOME. 

11:14.020 --> 11:15.180
IT'S BAD ENOUGH FOR YOU TO LOSE YOUR FIRST GAME, 

11:15.210 --> 11:17.150
NOW I CAN'T EVEN START MY OWN CAR. 

11:17.180 --> 11:21.180
THIS HAPPENS TO EVERYBODY, DON'T BE EMBARRASSED ABOUT IT. 

12:04.290 --> 12:06.190
GRANT, I WASN'T THAT EMBARRASSED. 

12:06.220 --> 12:09.040
THEN WHY DID YOU HIDE? 

12:09.070 --> 12:12.070
OH, WHY DOES THIS HOUSE HAVE TO STINK SO BAD? 

12:12.100 --> 12:15.100
YOU'LL GET USED TO IT AFTER A COUPLE OF HOURS. 

12:15.130 --> 12:18.190
HONEY, WE GOTTA DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE CAR BECAUSE THE ONLY 

12:18.220 --> 12:21.090
THING IT DOES FAITHFULLY FOR US IS BREAK DOWN. 

12:21.120 --> 12:22.290
THAT'S ABOUT RIGHT. 

12:23.020 --> 12:27.170
WOULD IT NOT BE BETTER JUST TO GET A SMALL NEW CAR. 

12:27.200 --> 12:29.030
YOU KNOW, WE CAN'T AFFORD THAT. 

12:29.060 --> 12:30.080
HOW DO OTHER PEOPLE DO IT? 

12:30.110 --> 12:33.090
 OTHER PEOPLE MAKE  MORE THAN $24,000 A YEAR. 

12:33.120 --> 12:35.100
YOU MAKE $6,000, THAT TAKES US TO $30,000. 

12:35.130 --> 12:38.130
WHICH IS ENOUGH HELP US WITH REPAIRS OCCASIONALLY, 

12:38.160 --> 12:40.230
NOT WITH A NEW CAR PAYMENT. 

12:40.260 --> 12:43.250
 BESIDES, THERE'S OTHER BILLS  WE DON'T NORMALLY HAVE TO PAY. 

12:43.280 --> 12:46.060
LIKE WHAT? 

12:46.090 --> 12:48.280
LIKE MY DOCTOR BILL. 

12:49.010 --> 12:52.030
YOU SAW HER TODAY. 

12:52.060 --> 12:53.280
WHAT DID SHE SAY? 

12:54.010 --> 12:55.250
SHE SAID THAT I'M FINE. 

12:55.280 --> 12:57.240
MY NUMBERS ARE NORMAL, AND SHE SAW NOTHING 

12:57.270 --> 13:00.130
THAT GAVE HER CONCERN. 

13:00.160 --> 13:02.110
THAT'S GOOD. 

13:02.140 --> 13:05.000
IT DOESN'T MEAN THE PROBLEM IS WITH YOU. 

13:05.030 --> 13:07.140
WHAT ELSE CAN IT MEAN? 

13:07.170 --> 13:09.230
WE MAY JUST NOT HAVE GIVEN IT ENOUGH TIME. 

13:09.260 --> 13:13.120
FOUR YEARS? 

13:13.150 --> 13:17.210
YOU STILL HOPING WE'LL HAVE A BABY? 

13:17.240 --> 13:19.240
YOU KNOW I AM. 

13:19.270 --> 13:21.140
 ME TOO. 

13:21.170 --> 13:25.250
 I CATCH MYSELF THINKING  ABOUT IT MORE AND MORE. 

13:25.280 --> 13:30.260
DON'T YOU WANT TO KNOW IF SOMETHING'S PREVENTING IT? 

13:33.090 --> 13:36.060
ARE YOU AFRAID OF GETTING CHECKED OUT? 

13:36.090 --> 13:38.060
YES. 

13:38.090 --> 13:43.070
GRANT, I'M STILL CLINGING TO A HOPE 

13:43.100 --> 13:48.130
THAT ONE DAY WE'LL HAVE CHILDREN. 

13:48.160 --> 13:52.140
I IMAGINE 'EM RUNNING IN THIS HOUSE. 

13:52.170 --> 13:56.050
I HEAR 'EM PLAYING IN THE BACKYARD 

13:56.080 --> 14:02.060
OR RUNNING TO OUR BED DURING A THUNDER STORM. 

14:02.090 --> 14:07.170
 AND I THINK ABOUT  READING 'EM STORIES 

14:07.200 --> 14:12.260
AND TEACHING 'EM SONGS. 

14:12.290 --> 14:22.100
AND I JUST KEEP THINKING, HOW CAN I MISS SOMEONE SO MUCH 

14:22.130 --> 14:27.030
THAT I HAVE NEVER MET? 

14:28.210 --> 14:33.130
I'LL GO. 

14:39.290 --> 14:42.060
STANLEY? 

14:42.090 --> 14:45.060
STANLEY. 

14:45.090 --> 14:47.020
STANLEY, DO YOU WANT TO TELL ME WHAT YOU'RE DOING 

14:47.050 --> 14:49.220
ON THE TOP OF MY DESK? 

14:49.250 --> 14:51.070
NO. 

14:51.100 --> 14:55.090
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW YOU GOT ON TOP OF MY DESK? 

14:55.120 --> 14:56.190
NO. 

14:56.220 --> 15:00.090
I SUGGEST YOU GET DOWN IMMEDIATELY. 

15:07.060 --> 15:09.260
YOU TWO CAN TELL COACH TAYLOR THAT THE REASON WHY YOU'RE LATE 

15:09.290 --> 15:11.160
FOR PRACTICE TODAY IS BECAUSE 

15:11.190 --> 15:13.230
YOU'VE BEEN SITTING IN DETENTION. 

15:13.260 --> 15:15.160
OH COME ON MS. CARTER, THAT WAS SOME SERIOUS HUMOR. 

15:15.190 --> 15:17.090
I'LL GET YOUR SERIOUS ABOUT YOUR HUMOR 

15:17.120 --> 15:21.100
WHEN YOU GET SERIOUS ABOUT YOUR STUDIES. 

15:22.290 --> 15:24.240
FIFTY-FIVE? 

15:24.270 --> 15:27.000
WELL, IF YOU WANT TO ANNOUNCE YOUR GRADE TO THE ENTIRE CLASS, 

15:27.030 --> 15:30.160
YOU GO RIGHT AHEAD. 

15:30.190 --> 15:32.220
FIFTY-SEVEN. 

15:35.190 --> 15:38.160
 SO BASICALLY WE GOT THE  TOUGHEST SCHEDULE WE EVER HAD 

15:38.190 --> 15:40.190
 AND LESS TALENT  THAN WE EVER HAD. 

15:40.220 --> 15:43.040
WELL, AT LEAST WE GOT DEWEY COUNTY ON FRIDAY NIGHT. 

15:43.070 --> 15:46.080
THAT'LL BE A PRETTY EASY WIN. 

15:46.110 --> 15:48.140
I'M CONCERNED IT MIGHT BE OUR ONLY WIN. 

15:48.170 --> 15:50.070
NAH, WE'LL PULL THREE OR FOUR OUT. 

15:50.100 --> 15:53.100
THAT'LL GIVE US ANOTHER AVERAGE SEASON. 

15:54.000 --> 15:57.110
I'M SO SICK OF AVERAGE SEASONS. 

15:57.140 --> 15:58.180
I GOTTA GO. 

15:58.210 --> 15:59.290
WHERE YOU GOING? 

16:00.040 --> 16:01.060
GOT A DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT. 

16:01.090 --> 16:02.240
FOR WHAT? 

16:02.270 --> 16:04.080
I HAVE A DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT. 

16:04.110 --> 16:05.080
FOR WHAT? 

16:05.110 --> 16:06.180
LEAVE THE MAN ALONE. 

16:06.210 --> 16:08.190
HE DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU. 

16:08.220 --> 16:11.120
SO WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU, MAN? 

16:11.150 --> 16:16.120
I'LL BE BACK IN A COUPLE OF HOURS. 

16:16.150 --> 16:17.170
NOW LOOK WHAT YOU DID. 

16:17.200 --> 16:19.070
YOU DONE MADE HIM MAD. 

16:19.100 --> 16:20.070
ME? 

16:20.100 --> 16:21.180
YOU'RE THE ONE THAT MADE HIM MAD. 

16:21.210 --> 16:23.080
NO, NOT ME. 

16:23.110 --> 16:25.110
BESIDES, I KNOW WHERE HE'S GOING. 

16:25.140 --> 16:26.110
 WHERE? 

16:26.140 --> 16:28.240
HE'S GOING TO THE HAIR DOCTOR. 

16:28.270 --> 16:30.230
THE MAN IS GOING BALD. 

16:30.260 --> 16:32.230
YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED THAT WHOLE UNDERDEVELOPED REGION 

16:32.260 --> 16:33.260
RIGHT UP IN HERE? 

16:33.290 --> 16:35.060
OH, YOU'RE ONE TO TALK, SLICK. 

16:35.080 --> 16:38.290
NAH, SEE, WHEN A BLACK MAN GOES BALD, HE STILL LOOKS GOOD. 

16:39.030 --> 16:42.110
LOOK AT MICHAEL JORDAN, GEORGE FOREMAN, 

16:42.140 --> 16:45.200
SAMUEL L. JACKSON, CLASSY LOOKING BROTHERS. 

16:45.230 --> 16:47.060
WHO YOU GOT? 

16:47.090 --> 16:48.210
KOJAK? 

16:48.240 --> 16:52.000
YEAH, COACH GOIN' TO GET HIM SOME PLUGS. 

16:52.030 --> 16:54.210
GRANT WOULD NOT GET PLUGS. 

16:54.240 --> 16:57.240
DON'T LAUGH, YOU NEXT. 

16:59.110 --> 17:04.130
 

17:10.280 --> 17:16.150
 IT FEELS LIKE A BRAND-NEW DAY.  

17:16.180 --> 17:20.070
 AND I KNOW I'M NOT THE SAME.  

17:20.100 --> 17:22.040
YOUR SOCCER SKILLS GET BETTER EVERY YEAR, SON. 

17:22.070 --> 17:23.210
IT DOESN'T MATTER, DAD. 

17:23.240 --> 17:25.070
SHILOH DOESN'T HAVE A SOCCER TEAM. 

17:25.100 --> 17:26.100
THEY PLAY FOOTBALL. 

17:26.130 --> 17:28.270
SO, WHY NOT KICK FOR THE FOOTBALL TEAM? 

17:29.000 --> 17:30.210
THEY'VE ALREADY GOT A GOOD KICKER. 

17:30.240 --> 17:33.160
I'M SURE THEY WOULDN'T MIND HAVING TWO GOOD KICKERS. 

17:33.190 --> 17:35.230
DAD, I'M TOO SMALL, AND I REALLY 

17:35.260 --> 17:38.060
JUST DON'T FEEL LIKE GETTING KILLED. 

17:38.090 --> 17:39.280
ARE YOU SAYING YOU'RE NOT INTERESTED 

17:40.010 --> 17:43.090
OR YOU'D LIKE TO TRY OUT, BUT YOU'RE AFRAID? 

17:43.120 --> 17:45.090
WHAT IF I DON'T EVEN MAKE THE TEAM? 

17:45.120 --> 17:47.250
WELL, YOU'RE ALREADY NOT ON THE TEAM. 

17:47.280 --> 17:50.170
I MEAN YOU CAN'T GET ANYMORE NOT ON THE TEAM 

17:50.200 --> 17:52.040
THAN YOU ARE RIGHT NOW. 

17:52.070 --> 17:53.160
OKAY, DAD. 

17:53.190 --> 17:55.110
DAVID, YOU CAN'T BE AFRAID OF FAILURE. 

17:55.140 --> 17:57.210
EVERYONE FAILS AT SOME POINT. 

17:57.240 --> 18:01.100
SO YOU THINK I SHOULD TRY OUT FOR THE FOOTBALL TEAM? 

18:01.130 --> 18:03.200
WELL, IF YOU'RE WAITING AROUND FOR SOCCER, 

18:03.230 --> 18:06.130
IT AIN'T GONNA HAPPEN. 

18:08.190 --> 18:12.270
 

18:15.280 --> 18:17.220
COACH OWENS, HAVE YOU GOT A MINUTE? 

18:17.250 --> 18:19.210
YEAH. 

18:19.240 --> 18:23.200
LOOK, UM, SOME OF THE MEN HAVE BEEN TALKING. 

18:23.230 --> 18:25.140
WE REALLY WANT TO SEE THIS SCHOOL SUCCEED 

18:25.170 --> 18:28.190
WITH OUR FOOTBALL PROGRAM, AND I KNOW YOU FEEL THE SAME WAY TOO. 

18:28.220 --> 18:32.270
BUT FRANKLY, WE DON'T EVER SEE THAT HAPPENING 

18:33.000 --> 18:34.200
WHILE COACH TAYLOR IS HERE. 

18:34.230 --> 18:37.150
WELL, YOU KNOW WE'RE IN A REBUILDING SEASON. 

18:37.180 --> 18:39.230
LOOK, I KNOW HE'S A FINE MAN AND ALL, 

18:39.260 --> 18:43.140
BUT HE'S HAD 6 YEARS HERE AND NOTHING SIGNIFICANT 

18:43.170 --> 18:45.150
TO EVEN SHOW FOR IT. 

18:45.180 --> 18:49.070
YOU KNOW, I HONESTLY BELIEVE YOU WOULD MAKE A BETTER HEAD COACH. 

18:57.050 --> 19:00.070
SOME OF US HAVE REQUESTED A MEETING WITH MR. REICHER. 

19:00.100 --> 19:03.200
IF YOU WOULD JUST SUPPORT US, I REALLY BELIEVE 

19:03.230 --> 19:06.200
THIS COULD GO A LOT EASIER. 

19:06.230 --> 19:08.150
MR. PERVIS, I DON'T KNOW. 

19:08.180 --> 19:10.200
LOOK, IT'S NOT LIKE WE'RE TRYING TO HURT THE GUY. 

19:10.230 --> 19:15.050
WHAT WE'RE DOING IS FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE SCHOOL. 

19:15.080 --> 19:16.280
YOU JUST THINK ABOUT IT. 

19:21.010 --> 19:23.290
GOOD HUSTLE, CASEY. 

19:26.090 --> 19:27.230
WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT? 

19:27.260 --> 19:29.100
WHAT? 

19:29.130 --> 19:31.250
ALVIN PERVIS. 

19:31.280 --> 19:34.110
OH, WE WERE JUST TALKING. 

19:34.140 --> 19:36.110
EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT? 

19:36.140 --> 19:38.110
YEAH. 

19:38.140 --> 19:40.120
 MR. TAYLOR. 

19:40.150 --> 19:41.250
YES. 

19:41.280 --> 19:44.070
I'M LARRY CHILDERS. 

19:44.100 --> 19:45.240
THIS IS MY SON, DAVID. 

19:45.270 --> 19:48.010
HE'S A JUNIOR, AND WE'RE NEW TO THE SCHOOL THIS YEAR. 

19:48.040 --> 19:49.070
WELL, GOOD TO MEET YOU. 

19:49.100 --> 19:50.090
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YA? 

19:50.100 --> 19:51.230
WELL, I JUST WANTED TO INTRODUCE MYSELF TO YOU, 

19:51.260 --> 19:53.090
AND DAVID WANTED TO KNOW IF IT WAS TOO LATE TO TRY OUT 

19:53.120 --> 19:54.160
 FOR THE TEAM. 

19:54.190 --> 19:55.200
YOU A FOOTBALL PLAYER? 

19:55.230 --> 19:57.020
WELL, I'VE ALWAYS PLAYED SOCCER, 

19:57.050 --> 19:59.080
BUT I FIGURED I COULD TRY OUT AS A KICKER. 

19:59.110 --> 20:00.260
OKAY, WELL I GOT A PRETTY GOOD KICKER, 

20:00.290 --> 20:02.190
BUT I WOULDN'T MIND LETTING YOU TRY OUT. 

20:02.220 --> 20:04.240
JONATHAN, COME HERE. 

20:04.270 --> 20:06.040
THIS IS JONATHAN. 

20:06.070 --> 20:08.280
HE HOLDS FOR OUR MAIN KICKER, JOSHUA WEBSTER. 

20:09.010 --> 20:11.090
JONATHAN, THIS IS DAVID CHILDERS. 

20:11.120 --> 20:13.010
HE WANTS TO TRY OUT AS A KICKER. 

20:13.040 --> 20:14.130
WHY DON'T YOU TWO GO OUT THERE AND TRY A FEW KICKS 

20:14.160 --> 20:15.230
JUST TO GET YOUR FEET WET A LITTLE BIT? 

20:15.260 --> 20:17.080
ALL RIGHT, SURE. 

20:17.110 --> 20:18.150
THANK YOU, SIR. 

20:18.180 --> 20:19.200
IF YOU DON'T MIND, I'LL JUST HANG AROUND 

20:19.230 --> 20:20.220
'TIL PRACTICE IS OVER. 

20:20.250 --> 20:21.220
NO PROBLEM. 

20:21.250 --> 20:23.110
GOOD TO MEET YA. 

20:23.140 --> 20:24.260
YA'LL JUST MOVE HERE? 

20:24.290 --> 20:26.190
YEAH, FROM ATHENS. 

20:26.220 --> 20:28.280
MY DAD GOT A JOB TEACHING AT THE COLLEGE. 

20:29.010 --> 20:30.140
THAT'S COOL. 

20:30.170 --> 20:32.190
I'M USED TO KICKIN' SOCCER BALLS, 

20:32.220 --> 20:35.080
BUT I THOUGHT I COULD AT LEAST TRY OUT. 

20:35.110 --> 20:36.250
WELL, JOSH IS A PRETTY GOOD KICKER, 

20:36.280 --> 20:38.120
BUT HE'S ALSO A RECEIVER. 

20:38.150 --> 20:39.290
I THINK HE LIKES THAT BETTER THAN KICKING. 

20:40.020 --> 20:42.180
HERE YOU GO. 

20:47.250 --> 20:52.240
 

20:53.230 --> 20:57.040
I'M SORRY. 

20:57.070 --> 21:01.140
MAN, I'M SORRY. 

21:01.170 --> 21:05.210
I'M SORRY. 

21:05.240 --> 21:07.080
OWW! 

21:07.110 --> 21:09.000
SORRY ABOUT THAT. 

21:09.030 --> 21:11.020
IT'S ALL RIGHT. 

21:11.260 --> 21:14.260
 

21:15.290 --> 21:16.260
HEY, WATCH IT. 

21:16.290 --> 21:18.110
SORRY. 

21:18.140 --> 21:21.080
 EVERYONE IS DREAMIN' AND THE WORLD IS SO COLORFUL.  

21:21.110 --> 21:30.060
 YOU LOOK BACK AT ME AND OOH, IT MAKES ME SAY, I'M--  

21:30.090 --> 21:32.020
 MATT. 

21:32.050 --> 21:37.020
 MATT. 

21:37.050 --> 21:38.140
LET'S GO. 

21:38.170 --> 21:39.280
I'M GOING WITH BROCK FOR A LITTLE WHILE. 

21:40.010 --> 21:41.190
NOT TONIGHT, YOU'RE COMING HOME. 

21:41.220 --> 21:42.190
WHY? 

21:42.220 --> 21:44.010
DON'T ARGUE WITH ME, LET'S GO! 

21:44.040 --> 21:45.280
 NO DAD,  I'LL BE HOME LATER. 

21:46.010 --> 21:47.250
MATT. 

21:52.170 --> 21:57.170
 

22:06.040 --> 22:08.200
THAT OLD MAN STILL COME EVERY WEEK TO PRAY IN THE HALLWAY? 

22:08.230 --> 22:12.000
MR. BRIDGES, PRAYS FOR THE STUDENTS 

22:12.030 --> 22:13.260
AS HE PASSES THEIR LOCKER. 

22:13.290 --> 22:16.020
 HOW LONG HE'S  BEEN DOING THAT? 

22:16.050 --> 22:19.030
HE'S BEEN PRAYING FOR REVIVAL SINCE BEFORE I GOT HERE. 

22:19.060 --> 22:21.140
LORD KNOWS WE NEED IT. 

22:21.170 --> 22:23.250
APATHY IN THE SCHOOL'S ABOUT AS BAD AS OUR FOOTBALL RECORD. 

22:23.280 --> 22:25.240
OH, THAT REMINDS ME, 

22:25.270 --> 22:29.220
I THINK YOU SHOULD GO AHEAD AND LET DAVID CHILDERS ON THE TEAM. 

22:29.250 --> 22:31.140
YOU SEE SOMETHIN' THERE? 

22:31.170 --> 22:34.130
 WELL, HE'S JUST  USED TO PLAYING SOCCER. 

22:34.160 --> 22:38.250
HE AIN'T THAT STRONG, BUT HE SHOWS PROMISE. 

22:38.280 --> 22:40.080
ALL RIGHT. 

22:40.110 --> 22:42.070
I'LL GIVE HIM A SHOT. 

22:45.150 --> 22:50.150
 

22:54.150 --> 22:56.090
SET, HUT! 

23:06.260 --> 23:09.260
STAY IN THE GAME! 

23:15.220 --> 23:17.020
NO! 

23:17.050 --> 23:20.240
 NO! 

23:22.190 --> 23:25.250
SOMEONE TELL ME HOW WE LOST TO DEWEY COUNTY 21 TO 7, 

23:25.280 --> 23:28.180
21 TO 7! 

23:28.210 --> 23:30.100
DEWEY COUNTY HASN'T BEATEN SHILOH SINCE YOU WERE 

23:30.130 --> 23:32.120
IN KINDERGARTEN! 

23:32.150 --> 23:34.070
 I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU  CALL THAT JUNK OUT THERE, 

23:34.100 --> 23:37.280
 BUT IT SURE WASN'T FOOTBALL! 

23:38.010 --> 23:39.030
NINE DROPPED PASSES. 

23:39.060 --> 23:40.050
FOUR FUMBLES. 

23:40.080 --> 23:41.070
THREE INTERCEPTIONS. 

23:41.080 --> 23:43.180
THEIR DEFENSE SCORED MOST OF THEIR POINTS! 

23:43.210 --> 23:46.140
YOU GAVE THE GAME AWAY! 

23:46.170 --> 23:48.170
YOU CAN'T WIN FOOTBALL GAMES IF YOU DON'T PLAY TOGETHER 

23:48.200 --> 23:50.110
AS A TEAM! 

23:50.140 --> 23:52.080
 YOU CAN'T WIN GAMES WHEN  YOU'RE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT 

23:52.110 --> 23:54.230
WHAT YOU'RE DOING AFTERWARDS! 

23:54.260 --> 23:56.280
AND YOU CAN'T LEARN THE PLAYS WHEN YOU MISS PRACTICE 'CAUSE 

23:57.010 --> 24:01.050
YOU'RE SITTIN' IN DETENTION! 

24:01.080 --> 24:03.120
I'M SICK OF THE APATHY ON THIS TEAM. 

24:03.150 --> 24:05.080
IF WE'RE NOT HERE TO WIN FOOTBALL GAMES, 

24:05.110 --> 24:08.190
THEN WHY ARE WE HERE? 

24:14.050 --> 24:15.290
 SO DO YOU  AGREE WITH HIM? 

24:16.020 --> 24:17.090
I DON'T KNOW. 

24:17.120 --> 24:19.090
I GUESS. 

24:19.120 --> 24:23.050
ONLY A FEW GUYS ON THE TEAM REALLY SEEM TO CARE. 

24:23.080 --> 24:25.230
SO ARE YOU READY TO PLAY IN A GAME? 

24:25.260 --> 24:26.290
I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY WOULD USE ME 

24:27.020 --> 24:28.220
WHEN THEY'VE GOT JOSHUA WEBSTER. 

24:28.250 --> 24:31.190
HE CAN KICK A 45-YARD FIELD GOAL. 

24:31.220 --> 24:33.170
I BET YOU COULD TOO. 

24:33.200 --> 24:37.000
DAD, I CAN BARELY KICK A 35-YARD FIELD GOAL. 

24:37.030 --> 24:40.210
AT THE END OF THE GAME, I'M KINDA GLAD I DIDN'T PLAY. 

24:40.240 --> 24:43.030
THAT WAY I CAN'T MESS UP. 

24:43.060 --> 24:45.160
THAT'S FEAR, SON. 

24:45.190 --> 24:48.160
I JUST DON'T WANT TO EMBARRASS THE TEAM. 

24:48.190 --> 24:53.040
DAVID, I'VE ASKED GOD SINCE YOU WERE A BABY THAT HE WOULD 

24:53.070 --> 24:57.060
SHOW HOW STRONG HE IS IN YOUR LIFE AND THAT THROUGH YOU, 

24:57.090 --> 25:00.270
PEOPLE WOULD SEE HOW GOOD HE IS. 

25:01.000 --> 25:05.000
THEN WHY WOULD HE MAKE ME SO SMALL, AND WEAK? 

25:05.030 --> 25:08.200
TO SHOW HOW MIGHTY HE IS. 

25:08.230 --> 25:11.040
WHY DON'T WE GO AHEAD AND WASH UP FOR DINNER. 

25:11.070 --> 25:12.160
WE CAN FINISH THIS LATER. 

25:12.190 --> 25:15.130
ALL RIGHT. 

26:08.140 --> 26:10.130
DAD! 

26:13.200 --> 26:15.020
OKAY, I'M OKAY. 

26:15.050 --> 26:16.250
WHAT WERE YOU DOING? 

26:16.280 --> 26:18.170
YOU MISSED A SPOT UP THERE. 

26:18.200 --> 26:20.070
I THOUGHT I COULD GET IT FOR YOU. 

26:20.100 --> 26:23.000
I GUESS I GOT A LITTLE TOO AMBITIOUS. 

26:23.030 --> 26:27.030
I WAS JUST TRYING TO TAKE A SWING AT IT. 

26:39.060 --> 26:40.280
SO UM, WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? 

26:41.010 --> 26:46.020
I MEAN IS THERE A PROCEDURE OR UM, I MEAN WHAT ARE MY OPTIONS? 

26:46.050 --> 26:48.080
GRANT, FIRST YOU NEED TO REALIZE, 

26:48.110 --> 26:50.190
THIS IS A FAIRLY COMMON PROBLEM FOR MEN. 

26:50.220 --> 26:53.200
THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF COUPLES WHO ARE UNABLE TO HAVE CHILDREN. 

26:53.230 --> 26:55.180
YOU DO HAVE OPTIONS, 

26:55.210 --> 26:58.110
ALTHOUGH THERE'S ONLY A 10% CHANCE OF SUCCESS. 

26:58.140 --> 27:01.280
MANY COUPLES HAVE TRIED IN VITRO FERTILIZATION. 

27:02.010 --> 27:03.240
WE CAN'T AFFORD THAT. 

27:03.270 --> 27:06.240
WELL, THE OTHER OPTION IS TO ADOPT A CHILD, 

27:06.270 --> 27:09.150
BUT IT'S ABOUT AS EXPENSIVE EITHER WAY. 

27:09.180 --> 27:11.110
IF YOU'RE INTERESTED, I'LL PUT YOU IN TOUCH 

27:11.140 --> 27:14.010
WITH A LOCAL AGENCY. 

27:14.040 --> 27:17.140
I REALIZE THIS IS DIFFICULT FOR YOU TO HEAR, 

27:17.170 --> 27:21.000
BUT AT LEAST YOU AND YOUR WIFE CAN MAKE THE BEST DECISION NOW 

27:21.030 --> 27:23.190
THAT YOU KNOW WHERE YOU ARE. 

27:25.140 --> 27:30.140
 

27:37.180 --> 27:39.220
SORRY, I DIDN'T REALIZE ANYBODY WAS STILL HERE. 

27:39.250 --> 27:41.170
HEY, STEVE. 

27:41.200 --> 27:43.060
PUTTIN' IN LATE HOURS TONIGHT? 

27:43.090 --> 27:45.030
YEAH, I GUESS SO. 

27:45.060 --> 27:46.130
I CAN LOCK UP. 

27:46.160 --> 27:47.160
YOU CAN TAKE OFF. 

27:47.190 --> 27:50.110
ALL RIGHT, THANKS, COACH. 

27:59.060 --> 28:04.080
 

28:24.140 --> 28:26.160
 IT'S ABOUT THE BOYS NOW. 

28:26.190 --> 28:29.160
 I'M NOT ASKING YOU TO  THROW HIM OUT, SURE. 

28:29.190 --> 28:31.170
 IF SHILOH CAN INVEST  IN A WINNING COACH, 

28:31.200 --> 28:33.210
 WE DON'T NEED TO BE  SETTLING FOR SECOND BEST. 

28:33.240 --> 28:36.050
 YOU CAN LET HIM GO WITH AS  MUCH CLASS AS YOU WANT TO. 

28:36.080 --> 28:37.250
ALVIN, HE'S A GOOD MAN. 

28:37.280 --> 28:39.200
I'M NOT SAYING HE'S NOT A GOOD MAN. 

28:39.230 --> 28:42.070
I'M SAYING HE'S NOT A GOOD COACH. 

28:42.100 --> 28:44.150
COME ON DAN, JUST LOOK AT THE FACTS. 

28:44.180 --> 28:46.120
HIS RECORD SPEAKS FOR ITSELF. 

28:46.150 --> 28:48.020
WE NEED NEW LEADERSHIP. 

28:48.050 --> 28:50.060
 I STILL THINK HE  DESERVES MORE TIME. 

28:50.090 --> 28:51.110
MORE TIME? 

28:51.140 --> 28:52.220
HE'S HAD 6 YEARS. 

28:52.250 --> 28:55.060
IF HE WAS CAPABLE OF WINNING, HE WOULD HAVE DONE IT BY NOW. 

28:55.090 --> 28:57.160
 GRANT TAYLOR IS NOT  CAPABLE OF WINNING. 

28:57.190 --> 28:59.030
 HE DOESN'T HAVE IT IN HIM. 

28:59.060 --> 29:00.230
 THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT. 

29:00.260 --> 29:02.180
DAN, I'M NOT HERE TO ATTACK THE COACH, 

29:02.210 --> 29:04.040
I'M JUST SAYING I WANT MY SON TO HAVE THE BEST 

29:04.070 --> 29:05.140
FOOTBALL PROGRAM POSSIBLE. 

29:05.170 --> 29:06.240
 THAT'S RIGHT. 

29:06.250 --> 29:07.270
LOOK, MY SON'S GOT A CHANCE FOR A FOOTBALL SCHOLARSHIP IF 

29:08.000 --> 29:09.250
HE'S TAUGHT BY THE RIGHT COACH. 

29:09.280 --> 29:11.250
MATT'S GONNA BE A SENIOR NEXT YEAR. 

29:11.280 --> 29:14.290
I DON'T WANT TO SEE HIM LOSE THIS OPPORTUNITY. 

29:15.020 --> 29:16.190
 BRADY, YOU'RE  AWFULLY QUIET. 

29:16.220 --> 29:19.060
 WHAT'S YOUR  TAKE ON THIS? 

29:19.090 --> 29:21.250
HONESTLY, I DON'T KNOW. 

29:21.280 --> 29:24.180
SOMETIMES I THINK GRANT COULD DO A BETTER JOB 

29:24.210 --> 29:26.170
OF BUILDING THIS FOOTBALL PROGRAM. 

29:26.200 --> 29:28.250
BUT THEN OTHER TIMES I THINK HE'S DOING JUST 

29:28.280 --> 29:31.250
AS GOOD AS ANYONE ELSE WOULD IN THIS SITUATION. 

29:31.290 --> 29:34.020
 BRADY, YOU CAN DO  BETTER THAN COACH TAYLOR. 

29:34.050 --> 29:36.220
 WHAT WE NEED IS A CHANGE. 

29:36.250 --> 29:38.200
 WE'RE LOSING  BOOSTER SUPPORT. 

29:38.230 --> 29:40.120
 GAME ATTENDANCE IS DOWN. 

29:40.150 --> 29:42.280
AND FROM THE LOOKS OF IT, WE'VE ALREADY LOST THIS SEASON. 

29:43.010 --> 29:47.160
 DAN, WE GOT A WEAK PROGRAM,  BECAUSE WE GOT A WEAK COACH. 

29:47.190 --> 29:49.060
 HE'S DEAD WEIGHT. 

29:49.090 --> 29:51.260
 WE NEED TO CUT HIM LOOSE. 

29:52.220 --> 29:57.270
 

30:02.270 --> 30:06.160
HAVE YOU BEEN AT SCHOOL ALL THIS TIME? 

30:06.190 --> 30:08.200
YES. 

30:08.230 --> 30:13.150
I TRIED TO CALL YOU AN HOUR AGO, IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT? 

30:19.050 --> 30:23.050
GRANT, TALK TO ME. 

30:25.270 --> 30:29.210
I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO START. 

30:29.240 --> 30:34.100
WHAT'S GOING ON? 

30:34.130 --> 30:38.210
I WAS TRYING TO LOCK UP FOR STEVE, 

30:38.240 --> 30:44.030
AND I OVERHEARD DAN MEETING WITH SOME FATHERS. 

30:44.060 --> 30:49.170
 THEY DIDN'T KNOW  I WAS THERE. 

30:49.200 --> 30:54.090
BROOKE, THEY WERE PUSHING HIM TO GET RID OF ME. 

30:54.120 --> 31:00.070
 NEIL PRATER,  ALVIN PERVIS, LUKE RAY. 

31:00.100 --> 31:04.040
AND THEY SAID I WASN'T CAPABLE OF WINNING, 

31:04.070 --> 31:06.210
THEY CALLED ME DEAD WEIGHT. 

31:06.240 --> 31:09.000
THEY CAN'T MAKE DAN FIRE YOU. 

31:09.030 --> 31:10.200
YOU STILL GOT SUPPORT. 

31:10.230 --> 31:13.280
YOU JUST GO GET J.T. AND BRADY AND SEE HIM TOMORROW. 

31:14.010 --> 31:20.050
BRADY WAS THERE. 

31:23.040 --> 31:28.210
THEY'VE JUST LOST CONFIDENCE IN ME. 

31:28.240 --> 31:33.050
YOU KNOW, I WAS SO SURE I COULD TURN THIS PROGRAM AROUND, 

31:33.080 --> 31:37.270
AND I'VE JUST SUNK IT LOWER. 

31:38.000 --> 31:42.180
BROOKE, I'VE TRIED SO HARD, WHY CAN'T I WIN? 

31:42.210 --> 31:44.010
YOU CAN WIN. 

31:44.040 --> 31:47.050
STOP BEATING YOURSELF UP, GRANT. 

31:47.080 --> 31:49.260
BROOKE, I CAN'T PROVIDE YOU A DECENT HOME. 

31:49.290 --> 31:53.120
I CAN'T PROVIDE YOU A DECENT CAR. 

31:53.150 --> 31:58.170
I'M A FAILING COACH WITH A LOSING RECORD, 

31:58.200 --> 32:03.200
AND I CAN'T GIVE YOU THE CHILDREN YOU WANT. 

32:03.230 --> 32:07.230
WHAT? 

32:07.260 --> 32:14.270
IT'S ME, LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE IT'S ME. 

32:15.000 --> 32:20.270
 WE CAN'T HAVE OUR OWN  CHILDREN BECAUSE OF ME. 

32:21.000 --> 32:22.180
 WHAT'S GOD DOIN'? 

32:22.210 --> 32:28.010
I MEAN WHY IS IT SO HARD? 

32:28.040 --> 32:31.110
IT'S OKAY, GRANT. 

32:31.140 --> 32:34.110
IT'S OKAY. 

32:36.100 --> 32:43.230
 

34:08.090 --> 34:10.170
"I WILL LOVE THEE, O LORD, MY STRENGTH. 

34:10.200 --> 34:14.090
"THE LORD IS MY ROCK AND MY FORTRESS, MY DELIVERER; 

34:14.120 --> 34:17.140
"MY GOD IN WHOM I TRUST; 

34:17.170 --> 34:22.080
"MY SHIELD AND THE HORN OF MY SALVATION, MY STRONGHOLD. 

34:22.110 --> 34:26.120
"I WILL CALL UPON THE LORD WHO IS WORTHY TO BE PRAISED, 

34:26.150 --> 34:30.280
SO SHALL I BE SAVED FROM MY ENEMIES." 

34:31.010 --> 34:34.090
LORD, JESUS, WOULD YOU HELP ME? 

34:34.120 --> 34:37.260
I NEED YOU. 

34:37.290 --> 34:40.150
LORD, I FEEL LIKE THERE ARE GIANTS OF FEAR AND FAILURE 

34:40.180 --> 34:43.180
JUST STARING DOWN AT ME WAITING TO CRUSH ME, 

34:43.210 --> 34:46.020
AND I DON'T KNOW HOW TO BEAT 'EM, LORD. 

34:46.050 --> 34:50.220
I'M TIRED OF BEING AFRAID. 

34:50.250 --> 34:55.070
LORD, IF YOU WANT ME TO DO SOMETHING ELSE, SHOW ME. 

34:55.100 --> 35:00.180
IF YOU DON'T WANT ME TO HAVE CHILDREN, SO BE IT. 

35:00.210 --> 35:02.190
BUT YOU'RE MY GOD. 

35:02.220 --> 35:06.240
YOU'RE ON THE THRONE. 

35:06.270 --> 35:11.120
YOU'RE CAN HAVE MY HOPES AND MY DREAMS. 

35:11.150 --> 35:14.140
LORD, GIVE ME SOMETHING. 

35:14.170 --> 35:17.260
SHOW ME SOMETHING. 

35:22.040 --> 35:27.250
 

35:43.080 --> 35:45.190
IF THE LORD NEVER GIVES US CHILDREN, 

35:45.220 --> 35:49.030
WILL YOU STILL LOVE HIM? 

35:53.240 --> 35:58.240
 

36:08.090 --> 36:09.100
[WHISTLE BLOWS] 

36:09.130 --> 36:10.200
FIELD GOAL UNIT. 

36:10.230 --> 36:12.160
HOLD ON, JOSHUA, I WANT TO GIVE DAVID A SHOT AT THIS ONE. 

36:12.190 --> 36:14.260
DAVID, COME HERE. 

36:14.290 --> 36:16.030
THIS IS YOUR FIELD GOAL. 

36:16.060 --> 36:18.200
PUT US ON THE BOARD. 

36:35.020 --> 36:36.030
HUT! 

36:43.030 --> 36:44.100
IT'S ALL RIGHT, MAN, IT'S ALL RIGHT. 

36:44.130 --> 36:46.130
YOU'LL GET IT NEXT TIME. 

36:58.240 --> 37:01.150
DAD, I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY THEY LET ME ON THE TEAM. 

37:01.180 --> 37:03.150
DID YOU DO YOUR BEST, SON? 

37:03.180 --> 37:06.050
I KNEW I WAS GONNA MISS IT BEFORE I EVEN KICKED IT. 

37:06.080 --> 37:09.130
YOUR ACTIONS WILL ALWAYS FOLLOW YOUR BELIEFS, DAVID. 

37:09.160 --> 37:12.140
DAD, I CAN'T EVEN KICK IT STRAIGHT. 

37:12.170 --> 37:13.280
 AND I CAN'T WALK. 

37:14.010 --> 37:17.070
SHOULD I JUST STAY HOME AND POUT ABOUT IT? 

37:17.100 --> 37:22.000
 IF YOU ACCEPT DEFEAT, DAVID,  THEN THAT'S WHAT YOU'LL GET. 

37:26.170 --> 37:30.230
WELL BRADY, ANOTHER FINE EXAMPLE OF GRANT TAYLOR'S 

37:30.260 --> 37:33.200
WONDERFUL COACHING ABILITIES. 

37:33.230 --> 37:35.030
LOOK THE KIDS DON'T DESERVE IT. 

37:35.060 --> 37:36.280
THE FANS DON'T DESERVE IT. 

37:37.010 --> 37:38.280
WHEN YOU GONNA GET A BELLY FULL OF THIS GUY? 

37:39.010 --> 37:40.170
WHAT'S IT GONNA TAKE? 

37:40.200 --> 37:42.000
YOU GOT A CHANCE, MAN. 

37:42.030 --> 37:44.150
YOU GOT A CHANCE TO STEP IN AND TAKE OVER THIS PROGRAM 

37:44.180 --> 37:46.230
AND CARRY IT UP FOR A WHILE. 

37:46.260 --> 37:49.050
WHEN YOU GONNA GET SICK AND TIRED OF IT? 

37:49.080 --> 37:51.050
YOU GOT AN OPPORTUNITY HERE. 

37:51.080 --> 37:53.030
THIS PROGRAM'S GOING IN THE TANK. 

37:53.060 --> 37:55.070
REICHER'S GOT A-- 

38:10.000 --> 38:15.090
GRANT, HE CAME TO ME. 

38:15.120 --> 38:17.090
BRADY YOU'RE NOT DOING ANYBODY ANY FAVORS 

38:17.120 --> 38:18.290
SITTING ON THE FENCE. 

38:19.020 --> 38:22.110
YOU DETERMINE WHICH SIDE YOU WANT TO BE ON AND STAY ON IT. 

38:40.090 --> 38:43.160
MR. BRIDGES? 

38:43.190 --> 38:47.260
REVELATION 3 SAYS: WE SERVE A GOD THAT OPENS DOORS THAT 

38:47.290 --> 38:52.060
NO ONE CAN SHUT, AND HE SHUTS DOORS THAT NO ONE CAN OPEN. 

38:52.090 --> 38:56.120
HE SAYS, "BEHOLD, I HAVE PLACED BEFORE YOU AN OPEN DOOR 

38:56.150 --> 38:58.090
"THAT NO ONE CAN SHUT. 

38:58.120 --> 39:00.100
"I KNOW YOU HAVE A LITTLE STRENGTH, 

39:00.130 --> 39:06.230
YET YOU HAVE KEPT MY WORD AND HAVE NOT DENIED MY NAME." 

39:06.260 --> 39:10.090
 COACH TAYLOR, THE LORD IS  NOT THROUGH WITH YOU YET. 

39:10.120 --> 39:12.150
YOU STILL HAVE AN OPEN DOOR HERE, 

39:12.180 --> 39:16.160
AND UNTIL THE LORD MOVES YOU, YOU'RE TO BLOOM RIGHT WHERE 

39:16.190 --> 39:18.110
YOU'RE PLANTED. 

39:18.140 --> 39:23.030
I JUST FELT LED TO COME AND TELL YOU THAT TODAY. 

39:34.270 --> 39:39.050
MR. BRIDGES? 

39:39.080 --> 39:42.150
YOU BELIEVE GOD TOLD YOU TO COME TELL ME THAT? 

39:42.180 --> 39:46.140
I DO. 

39:46.170 --> 39:49.160
I ADMIT TO YOU, I HAVE BEEN STRUGGLING, 

39:49.190 --> 39:52.180
BUT I'VE ALSO BEEN PRAYING. 

39:52.210 --> 39:56.270
I JUST DON'T SEE HIM AT WORK HERE. 

39:57.000 --> 40:00.150
GRANT, I HEARD A STORY ABOUT TWO FARMERS 

40:00.180 --> 40:02.270
WHO DESPERATELY NEEDED RAIN. 

40:03.000 --> 40:04.290
AND BOTH OF THEM PRAYED FOR RAIN, 

40:05.020 --> 40:07.120
BUT ONLY ONE OF THEM WENT OUT AND PREPARED HIS FIELDS 

40:07.150 --> 40:09.130
TO RECEIVE IT. 

40:09.160 --> 40:13.060
WHICH ONE DO YOU THINK TRUSTED GOD TO SEND THE RAIN? 

40:13.090 --> 40:16.100
WELL, THE ONE WHO PREPARED HIS FIELDS FOR IT. 

40:16.130 --> 40:19.220
WHICH ONE ARE YOU? 

40:19.250 --> 40:22.130
GOD WILL SEND THE RAIN WHEN HE'S READY. 

40:22.160 --> 40:26.010
YOU NEED TO PREPARE YOUR FIELD TO RECEIVE IT. 

40:34.270 --> 40:43.080
 

41:13.010 --> 41:15.240
SO THIS IS YOUR NEW TEAM PHILOSOPHY? 

41:15.270 --> 41:17.150
WHAT DO YOU THINK? 

41:17.180 --> 41:21.130
I THINK THIS APPLIES TO ALL OF LIFE, NOT JUST FOOTBALL. 

41:21.160 --> 41:24.090
WELL, THAT'S MY POINT. 

41:26.000 --> 41:27.110
TEN BUCKS FOR THE PERSON WHO CAN TELL ME WHO WON 

41:27.140 --> 41:29.120
THE STATE CHAMPIONSHIP A DECADE AGO? 

41:29.150 --> 41:30.190
WALKER JENNINGS? 

41:30.220 --> 41:31.170
NO. 

41:31.200 --> 41:32.190
NORTH METRO? 

41:32.220 --> 41:33.270
STOP GUESSING. 

41:34.000 --> 41:36.100
YOU KNOW IT OR YOU DON'T. 

41:36.130 --> 41:38.020
HOW ABOUT 5 YEARS AGO? 

41:38.050 --> 41:39.100
GRACELAND? 

41:39.130 --> 41:41.130
THAT WAS 3 YEARS AGO. 

41:41.160 --> 41:45.040
YOU CAN'T REMEMBER, CAN YA? 

41:45.070 --> 41:47.240
LEADS ME TO ASK A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS. 

41:47.270 --> 41:50.030
WHAT'S THE PURPOSE OF THIS TEAM? 

41:50.060 --> 41:51.270
TO WIN BALL GAMES. 

41:52.000 --> 41:53.130
 THEN WHAT? 

41:53.160 --> 41:55.270
WE GET A TROPHY AND PEOPLE TALK ABOUT US. 

41:56.000 --> 41:57.210
MAYBE, FOR A WHILE. 

41:57.240 --> 41:59.080
THEN WHAT? 

41:59.110 --> 42:01.240
I DON'T KNOW, GET A SCHOLARSHIP, 

42:01.270 --> 42:06.240
PLAY FOR COLLEGE AND COACH LITTLE LEAGUE. 

42:06.270 --> 42:08.130
WHAT ARE YOU GETTING AT, GRANT? 

42:08.160 --> 42:10.110
YOU THINK WE'RE JUST WASTING OUR TIME? 

42:10.140 --> 42:13.060
IF OUR MAIN GOAL'S TO WIN FOOTBALL GAME'S THEN YES. 

42:13.090 --> 42:14.280
YOU DON'T WANT US TO WIN GAMES? 

42:15.010 --> 42:18.220
NO, NOT IF THAT'S OUR MAIN GOAL. 

42:18.250 --> 42:22.090
WINNING FOOTBALL GAMES IS TOO SMALL A THING TO LIVE FOR. 

42:22.120 --> 42:25.040
AND I LOVE FOOTBALL AS MUCH AS ANYBODY, 

42:25.070 --> 42:27.180
 BUT EVEN CHAMPIONSHIP TROPHIES  WILL ONE DAY COLLECT DUST 

42:27.210 --> 42:30.080
 AND BE FORGOTTEN. 

42:30.110 --> 42:34.230
IT'S JUST THAT SO FAR ALL OF THIS HAS BEEN ABOUT US, 

42:34.260 --> 42:36.220
HOW WE CAN LOOK GOOD. 

42:36.250 --> 42:39.240
 HOW WE CAN GET THE GLORY. 

42:39.270 --> 42:44.050
THE MORE I READ THIS BOOK, THE MORE I REALIZE 

42:44.080 --> 42:46.060
LIFE'S NOT ABOUT US. 

42:46.090 --> 42:50.010
 WE'RE NOT HERE JUST TO GET  GLORY, MAKE MONEY AND DIE. 

42:50.040 --> 42:55.060
THE BIBLE SAYS THAT GOD PUT US HERE FOR HIM, TO HONOR HIM. 

42:55.090 --> 42:58.130
JESUS SAID THE MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU CAN DO WITH YOUR LIFE 

42:58.160 --> 43:00.050
 IS TO LOVE GOD WITH  EVERYTHING YOU ARE 

43:00.080 --> 43:02.050
 AND LOVE OTHERS AS YOURSELF. 

43:02.080 --> 43:06.160
SO IF WE WIN EVERY GAME AND WE MISS THAT, WE'VE DONE NOTHING. 

43:06.190 --> 43:09.230
 FOOTBALL THEN MEANS NOTHING. 

43:09.260 --> 43:12.280
SO I'M HERE TO PRESENT YOU A NEW TEAM PHILOSOPHY. 

43:13.010 --> 43:16.050
I THINK THAT FOOTBALL IS JUST ONE OF THE TOOLS WE USE 

43:16.080 --> 43:18.020
TO HONOR GOD. 

43:18.050 --> 43:20.060
SO YOU THINK GOD DOES CARE ABOUT FOOTBALL? 

43:20.090 --> 43:22.170
I THINK HE CARES ABOUT YOUR FAITH. 

43:22.200 --> 43:24.230
HE CARES ABOUT WHERE YOUR HEART IS. 

43:24.260 --> 43:26.230
AND IF YOU CAN LIVE YOUR FAITH OUT ON THE FOOTBALL FIELD, 

43:26.260 --> 43:28.100
THEN YES GOD CARES ABOUT FOOTBALL 'CAUSE 

43:28.130 --> 43:30.050
HE CARES ABOUT YOU. 

43:30.080 --> 43:31.240
 HE SENT HIS SON  JESUS TO DIE FOR US 

43:31.270 --> 43:33.230
 SO WE COULD LIVE FOR HIM. 

43:33.260 --> 43:36.130
 THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE. 

43:36.160 --> 43:39.000
BUT SEE, IT'S NOT JUST ON THE FOOTBALL FIELD. 

43:39.030 --> 43:42.110
WE'VE GOTTA HONOR HIM IN OUR RELATIONSHIPS, 

43:42.140 --> 43:47.070
IN OUR RESPECT FOR AUTHORITY, IN THE CLASSROOM 

43:47.100 --> 43:55.040
AND WHEN YOU'RE AT HOME ALONE SURFING THE INTERNET. 

43:55.070 --> 43:57.130
I WANT GOD TO BLESS THIS TEAM SO MUCH PEOPLE TALK ABOUT 

43:57.160 --> 43:59.120
WHAT HE DID. 

43:59.150 --> 44:01.250
BUT IT MEANS WE GOTTA GIVE HIM OUR BEST IN EVERY AREA. 

44:01.280 --> 44:03.180
AND IF WE WIN, WE PRAISE HIM. 

44:03.210 --> 44:06.060
AND IF WE LOSE, WE PRAISE HIM. 

44:06.090 --> 44:11.080
EITHER WAY, WE HONOR HIM WITH OUR ACTIONS AND OUR ATTITUDES. 

44:11.110 --> 44:17.030
SO I'M ASKING YOU, WHAT ARE YOU LIVING FOR? 

44:17.060 --> 44:19.290
I'VE RESOLVED TO GIVE GOD EVERYTHING I'VE GOT, 

44:20.020 --> 44:24.000
THEN I'LL LEAVE THE RESULTS UP TO HIM. 

44:24.030 --> 44:27.260
I WANT TO KNOW IF YOU'LL JOIN ME? 

44:28.160 --> 44:30.260
YOUR ATTITUDE'S LIKE THE AROMA OF YOUR HEART. 

44:30.290 --> 44:35.140
IF YOUR ATTITUDE STINKS, IT MEANS YOUR HEART'S NOT RIGHT. 

44:35.170 --> 44:37.050
HE SURE IS PREACHING TODAY. 

44:37.080 --> 44:39.090
UM-HUM. 

44:39.280 --> 44:42.030
SNIFF.

44:45.170 --> 44:47.090
IT'S FINE. 

44:47.120 --> 44:49.180
THEN YOU'LL BE OKAY WITH THE DEATH CRAWL, RIGHT? 

44:49.210 --> 44:50.230

45:14.000 --> 45:16.220
LET'S RUN IT BACK! 

45:19.180 --> 45:21.010
AH, MAN. 

45:21.040 --> 45:24.290
AH, MAN THAT'S NOT EVEN FUNNY, DUDE. 

45:25.020 --> 45:27.210
SO COACH, HOW STRONG IS WESTFIELD THIS YEAR? 

45:27.240 --> 45:30.130
A LOT STRONGER THAN WE ARE. 

45:30.160 --> 45:33.210
YOU ALREADY WRITTEN FRIDAY NIGHT DOWN AS A LOSS, BROCK? 

45:33.240 --> 45:37.220
WELL, NOT IF I KNOW WE COULD BEAT 'EM. 

45:37.250 --> 45:39.210
COME HERE, BROCK. 

45:39.240 --> 45:42.260
YOU TOO, JEREMY. 

45:43.150 --> 45:44.190
WHAT AM I IN TROUBLE NOW? 

45:44.220 --> 45:45.230
NOT YET. 

45:45.260 --> 45:47.080
I WANT TO SEE YOU DO THE DEATH CRAWL AGAIN, 

45:47.110 --> 45:49.200
EXCEPT I WANNA SEE YOUR ABSOLUTE BEST. 

45:51.110 --> 45:53.110
WHAT, YOU WANT ME TO GO TO THE 30? 

45:53.140 --> 45:55.100
I THINK YOU CAN GO THE 50. 

45:55.130 --> 45:56.240
THE 50? 

45:56.270 --> 45:58.290
I CAN GO THE 50 IF NOBODY'S ON MY BACK. 

45:59.020 --> 46:00.170
I THINK YOU CAN DO IT WITH JEREMY ON YOUR BACK. 

46:00.200 --> 46:02.030
BUT EVEN IF YOU CAN'T, I WANT YOU TO PROMISE ME 

46:02.060 --> 46:03.140
YOU'RE GONNA DO YOUR BEST.

46:09.230 --> 46:11.110

46:11.140 --> 46:14.290
ALL RIGHT, ONE MORE THING, I WANT YOU TO DO IT BLINDFOLDED. 

46:15.020 --> 46:16.040
WHY? 

46:16.050 --> 46:17.100
'CAUSE I DON'T WANT YOU GIVIN' UP AT A CERTAIN POINT 

46:17.130 --> 46:18.230
WHEN YOU CAN GO FURTHER. 

46:18.260 --> 46:20.100
GET DOWN. 

46:20.130 --> 46:24.000
JEREMY, GET ON HIS BACK. 

46:24.030 --> 46:26.020

51:32.070 --> 51:34.090
THANK YOU. 

51:34.120 --> 51:37.000
SEE YA TOMORROW. 

51:51.260 --> 51:54.010
NEED A RIDE, MATT? 

51:54.040 --> 51:55.240
NO, MY DAD'S COMIN'. 

51:55.270 --> 51:59.170
AT LEAST HE BETTER BE. 

51:59.200 --> 52:01.250
CAN I SHOOT STRAIGHT WITH YOU FOR A MINUTE? 

52:01.280 --> 52:03.070
SURE. 

52:03.100 --> 52:05.180
I FEEL LIKE YOU OWE YOUR DAD MORE RESPECT. 

52:05.210 --> 52:06.200
WHY? 

52:06.230 --> 52:07.280
'CAUSE HE'S YOUR FATHER. 

52:08.010 --> 52:09.090
YOU DON'T KNOW HIM LIKE I KNOW HIM. 

52:09.120 --> 52:10.190
I DON'T HAVE TO KNOW HIM. 

52:10.220 --> 52:11.230
YOU NEED TO RESPECT HIM 'CAUSE IT'S 

52:11.260 --> 52:13.050
THE RIGHT THING TO DO. 

52:13.090 --> 52:16.090
YOU KNOW, COACH, MY DAD DOESN'T EVEN LIKE YOU. 

52:16.120 --> 52:18.260
HE THINKS THE SCHOOL NEEDS TO FIND SOMEBODY ELSE. 

52:18.290 --> 52:21.020
THAT'S BESIDES THE POINT. 

52:21.050 --> 52:22.170
THE SCRIPTURE SAYS TO HONOR YOUR PARENTS, 

52:22.200 --> 52:24.040
AND ALL YOU DO IS COMPLAIN. 

52:24.070 --> 52:25.220
ALL HE DOES IS BOSS ME AROUND. 

52:25.250 --> 52:27.150
HE DOESN'T EVEN TRY TO UNDERSTAND ME. 

52:27.180 --> 52:30.080
MATT, YOU CAN'T JUDGE YOUR FATHER BY HIS ACTIONS 

52:30.110 --> 52:32.220
AND THEN JUDGE YOURSELF BY YOUR INTENTIONS. 

52:32.250 --> 52:34.040
IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY. 

52:34.070 --> 52:36.210
YOU'RE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR HIM, YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOU. 

52:36.240 --> 52:38.290
YOU HONOR GOD BY HONORING YOUR AUTHORITY. 

52:39.020 --> 52:41.100
YOU REALLY BELIEVE IN ALL THAT HONORING GOD 

52:41.130 --> 52:43.110
AND FOLLOW JESUS STUFF? 

52:43.140 --> 52:46.040
YES, I DO. 

52:46.070 --> 52:49.050
WELL, I AIN'T TRYING TO BE DISRESPECTFUL, 

52:49.080 --> 52:51.190
BUT NOT EVERYBODY BELIEVES IN THAT. 

52:51.220 --> 52:54.180
RELIGION WORKS FOR SOME PEOPLE, BUT I'M JUST HERE 'CAUSE 

52:54.210 --> 52:56.210
I GOT KICKED OUT OF WESTVIEW. 

52:56.240 --> 52:58.280
MATT, NOBODY'S FORCING ANYTHING ON YOU. 

52:59.010 --> 53:01.020
FOLLOWING JESUS CHRIST IS THE DECISION YOU'RE GONNA 

53:01.050 --> 53:02.240
HAVE TO MAKE FOR YOURSELF. 

53:02.270 --> 53:06.040
YOU MAY NOT WANT TO ACCEPT IT 'CAUSE IT'LL CHANGE YOUR LIFE. 

53:06.070 --> 53:09.040
YOU'LL NEVER BE THE SAME. 

53:09.070 --> 53:12.180
I DO HOPE ONE DAY YOU REALIZE HOW MUCH HE LOVES YOU. 

53:12.210 --> 53:15.110
I'LL SEE YA TOMORROW. 

53:22.060 --> 53:25.090
[SCREAMING] 

53:25.120 --> 53:26.110
OKAY, I'LL GET HIM. 

53:26.140 --> 53:27.110
JUST GIVE ME THE BAT. 

53:27.140 --> 53:28.210
JUST BRING THAT TRASH BAG OVER HERE. 

53:28.240 --> 53:30.050
OOH, DON'T YOU LET THAT TOUCH ME. 

53:30.080 --> 53:31.160
I'M NOT GONNA LET HIM TOUCH YOU, BROOKE. 

53:31.190 --> 53:32.240
I'M GONNA GET HIM OUT OF HERE. 

53:32.270 --> 53:33.240
OOH. 

53:33.270 --> 53:34.240
MAN, HE STINKS. 

53:34.270 --> 53:36.150
OOH, I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT WAS IN MY HOUSE. 

53:36.180 --> 53:38.180
JUST MAKE SURE IT'S STILL DEAD! 

53:38.210 --> 53:40.270
IT'S DEAD, HE'S PROBABLY BEEN DEAD FOR WEEKS. 

53:41.000 --> 53:42.260
YOU JUST GET IT OUT OF HERE. 

53:42.290 --> 53:44.270
OUT, OUT. 

53:45.000 --> 53:45.270
STOP BEING AFRAID, COME HERE. 

53:46.000 --> 53:47.080
MMM-MMM. 

53:47.110 --> 53:48.230
HE LOOKS LIKE A BIG HAMSTER. 

53:48.260 --> 53:49.180
OH, UH-UH. 

53:49.210 --> 53:50.220
COME HERE, COME HERE. 

53:50.250 --> 53:52.000
JUST FACE YOUR FEAR. 

53:52.030 --> 53:54.010
LOOK, HE'S GOT A CUTE LITTLE TAIL THERE. 

53:54.040 --> 53:55.260
HE'S JUST GOT A BIG STINK. 

53:55.290 --> 53:59.120
LOOK, SEE HIS CUTE LITTLE EYES THERE. 

53:59.150 --> 54:01.110
SEE HIS TEETH, LOOK AT HIS TEETH. 

54:01.140 --> 54:02.230
IT ALMOST LOOKS LIKE HE'S MAD. 

54:02.260 --> 54:04.240
AHH! 

54:04.270 --> 54:06.080
YOU ARE TERRIBLE! 

54:06.110 --> 54:08.220
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU DID THAT TO ME, GRANT TAYLOR! 

54:08.250 --> 54:10.150
YOU ARE SO BAD! 

54:10.180 --> 54:11.290
WHOO! 

54:14.120 --> 54:17.060
 AIM IT RIGHT DOWN  THE MIDDLE, YOU GOT THIS. 

54:19.140 --> 54:20.280
 SET IT UP  FOR HIM AGAIN. 

54:21.010 --> 54:23.020
SORRY, COACH. 

54:23.050 --> 54:25.210
LISTEN SON, YOU ACT LIKE YOU'RE GONNA MISS 

54:25.240 --> 54:27.170
BEFORE YOU EVEN KICK THE BALL. 

54:27.200 --> 54:30.110
I SEE WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO CHANGE YOUR WHOLE KICKIN' PHILOSOPHY. 

54:30.140 --> 54:33.250
NOW SEE, YOU KICKIN' WIDE LEFT OR WIDE RIGHT, 

54:33.280 --> 54:36.090
BUT THAT AIN'T WHAT'S GONNA GET YOU HOME. 

54:36.120 --> 54:39.050
THE BALL HAS GOT TO GO THROUGH THE MIDDLE. 

54:39.080 --> 54:40.130
I KNOW, COACH. 

54:40.160 --> 54:41.250
NO, NO, YOU DON'T. 

54:41.280 --> 54:44.050
NOW WHAT'D THE SCRIPTURE SAY ABOUT THIS? 

54:44.080 --> 54:45.280
UM? 

54:46.010 --> 54:49.020
THE SCRIPTURE SAYS, "WIDE IS THE GATE AND BROAD IS THE WAY 

54:49.050 --> 54:51.130
THAT LEADS TO DESTRUCTION AND MANY THERE'LL BE 

54:51.160 --> 54:52.270
 THAT'LL FIND IT." 

54:53.000 --> 54:57.130
NOT TO US, THAT'S WIDE LEFT AND WIDE RIGHT. 

54:57.160 --> 55:00.160
BUT NARROW IS THE GATE AND STRAIGHT IS THE WAY THAT LEADS 

55:00.190 --> 55:04.170
TO LIFE, AND FEW THERE'LL BE THAT FIND IT. 

55:04.200 --> 55:07.210
ANYBODY CAN KICK IT WIDE LEFT OR WIDE RIGHT. 

55:07.240 --> 55:11.110
MY MAMA CAN KICK IT WIDE LEFT AND WIDE RIGHT. 

55:11.140 --> 55:13.170
BUT THAT AIN'T WHAT'S GONNA GET YOU HOME. 

55:13.200 --> 55:14.230
COME ON! 

55:14.260 --> 55:16.050
IT DON'T HAVE TO LOOK PRETTY. 

55:16.080 --> 55:17.230
IT DON'T HAVE TO LOOK SMOOTH. 

55:17.260 --> 55:20.060
IT CAN LOOK LIKE A DYIN' DUCK, 

55:20.090 --> 55:23.000
BUT THE BALL HAS GOT TO GO THROUGH THE MIDDLE. 

55:23.030 --> 55:24.080
OH, MY WORD! 

55:24.110 --> 55:27.250
NOW DAVID, YOU GONNA HAVE TO CHOOSE THE NARROW WAY 

55:27.280 --> 55:30.040
 'CAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY PATH  FOR YOU TO GET YOUR REWARD. 

55:30.070 --> 55:32.240
NOW SEND THIS BALL THROUGH THESE PEARLY POSTS. 

55:32.270 --> 55:34.090
 SET IT UP ONE MORE  TIME FOR ME, JONATHAN. 

55:34.120 --> 55:37.090
DAVID, I'VE NEVER HEARD IT THAT WAY BEFORE, 

55:37.120 --> 55:39.140
BUT THERE'S A LOT OF TRUTH TO WHAT HE'S SAYING. 

55:39.170 --> 55:42.020
LET'S SEE YOU KICK IT. 

55:43.050 --> 55:48.180
 

55:51.000 --> 55:54.090
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. 

55:58.240 --> 56:01.150
GRANT, ARE YOU NOT AWARE OF WHAT'S GOING ON OUTSIDE 

56:01.180 --> 56:02.210
ON THE FIELD? 

56:02.240 --> 56:03.210
WHAT? 

56:03.240 --> 56:05.240
YOU MIGHT WANT TO COME CHECK THIS OUT. 

56:08.240 --> 56:11.120
MITCH DECIDED TO BRING HIS BIBLE CLASS OUTSIDE TODAY. 

56:11.150 --> 56:13.140
AFTER HE STARTED TEACHING, MATT PRATER STOOD UP THERE 

56:13.170 --> 56:15.000
AND ACCEPTED CHRIST AS HIS LORD. 

56:15.030 --> 56:16.070
IT WAS AWESOME. 

56:16.080 --> 56:18.020
HE STARTED CONFESSING STUFF, YOU KNOW, FROM HIS LIFE. 

56:18.050 --> 56:19.270
HE STARTED ASKING HIS FRIENDS FOR FORGIVENESS. 

56:20.000 --> 56:22.010
NEXT THING WE KNOW, BOB DUKE STANDS UP 

56:22.040 --> 56:23.110
AND DOES THE SAME THING. 

56:23.140 --> 56:25.110
KIDS START BREAKING UP INTO GROUPS. 

56:25.140 --> 56:27.110
THEY BEGIN TO PRAY FOR EACH OTHER. 

56:27.140 --> 56:29.160
THEY BEGIN TO ASK FORGIVENESS FOR SINS THAT THEY COMMITTED. 

56:29.190 --> 56:31.120
THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR 3 HOURS. 

56:31.150 --> 56:34.110
HOW'D YOU NOT KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON? 

56:35.130 --> 56:38.190
 

56:38.220 --> 56:43.120
 YOU NEVER GIVE UP ON ME.  

56:43.150 --> 56:48.150
 NO YOU NEVER GIVE UP ON ME.  

56:48.180 --> 56:51.060
 THOUGH I'M WEAK, YOU ARE STRONG  

56:51.090 --> 56:53.240
 AND TOLD ME I STILL BELONG.  

56:53.270 --> 57:06.180
 NO, YOU NEVER, NEVER GIVE UP ON ME.  

57:06.210 --> 57:10.090
LORD, I ASK YOU TO LIFT THEM UP. 

57:10.120 --> 57:14.140
 YOU NEVER GIVE UP ON ME.  

57:14.170 --> 57:16.270
I ASK YOU TO BRING UP A GENERATION 

57:17.000 --> 57:20.000
THAT HAS A HEART FOR YOU, LORD. 

57:21.240 --> 57:25.210
COACH? 

57:28.050 --> 57:29.220
PROUD OF YOU, MATT. 

57:29.250 --> 57:31.140
I NEED TO TALK WITH MY DAD. 

57:31.170 --> 57:35.070
I'D LIKE TO GO SEE HIM. 

57:35.100 --> 57:37.230
I'LL TAKE YOU RIGHT NOW. 

57:39.140 --> 57:42.070
SO WHAT WE'VE DONE HERE IS WE'VE GAINED THESE FOUR LOTS 

57:42.100 --> 57:44.080
BY MOVING THEIR RETENTION POND DOWN HERE. 

57:44.110 --> 57:46.150
WE CAN TRY AND DO THAT THROUGH HERE, IF YOU WANT. 

57:46.190 --> 57:47.290
NO, I LIKE THIS. 

57:48.020 --> 57:49.040
THAT'S PERFECT. 

57:49.050 --> 57:51.190
 MR. PRATER, THERE'S  SOMEONE HERE TO SEE YOU. 

57:51.220 --> 57:53.130
SARAH, I'M IN A MEETING. 

57:53.160 --> 57:56.130
 IT'S YOUR SON. 

57:56.160 --> 57:57.280
WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO STEP OUT? 

57:58.010 --> 57:59.170
NO, IT'S OKAY. 

57:59.200 --> 58:02.190
SARAH, SEND HIM IN. 

58:06.250 --> 58:08.200
MATT, YOU OKAY? 

58:08.230 --> 58:10.120
I'M SORRY, DAD. 

58:10.150 --> 58:11.230
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE IN A MEETING. 

58:11.260 --> 58:14.050
WHAT IS IT, SON? 

58:14.080 --> 58:19.100
UH, DAD, I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT I'M SORRY. 

58:19.130 --> 58:23.140
I'M SORRY FOR THE WAY I'VE BEEN ACTING. 

58:23.170 --> 58:27.190
I GOT RIGHT WITH GOD TODAY, AND I JUST NEEDED TO SAY 

58:27.220 --> 58:31.250
THAT FROM NOW ON, I'LL RESPECT YOUR AUTHORITY. 

58:31.280 --> 58:35.190
WHATEVER YOU SAY GOES. 

58:35.220 --> 58:39.030
THAT'S IT. 

58:41.030 --> 58:42.230
YOU KNOW, I COULD COME BACK TOMORROW 

58:42.260 --> 58:45.160
IF THAT WOULD BE BETTER FOR YOU. 

58:45.190 --> 58:47.220
NO, IT'S OKAY. 

58:47.250 --> 58:49.150
I'M SORRY. 

58:49.180 --> 58:52.110
I A-- 

59:04.130 --> 59:07.190
FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH, I'D GIVE MY RIGHT ARM TO HEAR 

59:07.220 --> 59:12.040
MY SON SAY THAT TO ME. 

59:16.270 --> 59:20.150
I FEEL LIKE I'M STANDING BEFORE A NEW TEAM TONIGHT. 

59:20.180 --> 59:23.230
 IT'S A NEW DAY  AND A NEW GAME. 

59:23.260 --> 59:25.250
 WHAT YOU'VE EXPERIENCED IN  YOUR HEARTS THIS WEEK'S ABOUT 

59:25.280 --> 59:28.030
 TO BE RELEASED  ON THE FIELD. 

59:28.060 --> 59:31.240
 STAY HUMBLE  BUT CONFIDENT. 

59:31.270 --> 59:35.130
I WANT YOU TO TAKE THIS ONE, BROCK. 

59:38.000 --> 59:40.220
LORD, WE KNOW OUR LIVES ARE NOT ABOUT FOOTBALL, 

59:40.250 --> 59:43.140
BUT WE DO THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING US TO PLAY TONIGHT. 

59:43.170 --> 59:46.000
LORD, WE'RE GONNA GIVE YOU OUR BEST. 

59:46.030 --> 59:47.240
IF WE WIN, WE'LL PRAISE YOU. 

59:47.270 --> 59:49.200
AND IF WE LOSE, WE'LL PRAISE YOU. 

59:49.230 --> 59:51.270
WE'LL GIVE YOU ALL THE HONOR AND THE GLORY FOR THIS NIGHT, LORD. 

59:52.000 --> 59:52.270
 KEEP US SAFE. 

59:53.000 --> 59:54.120
IN JESUS' NAME I PRAY, AMEN. 

59:54.150 --> 59:55.220
AMEN. 

59:55.250 --> 59:57.210
 ALL RIGHT,  GUYS, LOOK AT ME. 

59:57.240 --> 01:00:01.150
 PLAY HARD, HAVE FUN. 

01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:13.160
 

01:00:28.140 --> 01:00:37.260
 YOU CAN ALL CALL ME CRAZY FOR THE THINGS THAT I MIGHT SAY.  

01:00:37.290 --> 01:00:42.250
 AND YOU CAN LAUGH ALL YOU WANT TO, YEAH,  

01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:49.020
 AND I KNOW THERE WILL COME A DAY WHEN WE ALL  

01:00:49.050 --> 01:00:57.060
 WILL COME TOGETHER AND LEARN TO SET ASIDE OUR WAYS.  

01:00:57.100 --> 01:01:02.080
 AND WE CAN LEARN TO LOVE OUR NEIGHBOR, YEAH,  

01:01:02.110 --> 01:01:05.160
 JUST LIKE WE WILL LOVE OURSELVES.  

01:01:05.190 --> 01:01:07.130
 WE GOT TO COME TOGETHER.  

01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:09.160
IN THE OLD TESTAMENT, NEHEMIAH HAD THE TASK OF 

01:01:09.190 --> 01:01:11.260
BUILDING A STONE WALL AROUND HIS CITY FOR PROTECTION. 

01:01:11.290 --> 01:01:15.050
BUT HE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH PEOPLE OR RESOURCES OR TIME. 

01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:17.180
BUT BECAUSE EACH PERSON WORKED ON THE STONE WALL THAT WAS IN 

01:01:17.210 --> 01:01:20.010
FRONT OF THEIR HOUSE, THEY GOT IT DONE IN RECORD TIME. 

01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:21.190
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO. 

01:01:21.220 --> 01:01:23.260
ON DEFENSE, YOU HAVE TO RESOLVE, 

01:01:23.290 --> 01:01:25.210
NOTHING GETS BY YOU AS AN INDIVIDUAL; 

01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:27.240
 NOTHING GETS BY US AS A TEAM. 

01:01:27.270 --> 01:01:31.260
I NEED YOU TO BUILD ME A STONE WALL. 

01:01:31.290 --> 01:01:36.240
 YOU CAN CALL ME A DREAMER.  

01:01:36.270 --> 01:01:41.200
 YET THESE DREAMS WILL COME TRUE.  

01:01:41.230 --> 01:01:45.160
 AND YES I AM A FIRM BELIEVER,  

01:01:45.190 --> 01:01:51.210
 YEAH, ANYTHING'S THE LORD CAN DO.  

01:01:51.240 --> 01:02:01.110
 CAN'T WE ALL COME TOGETHER, LET THE LORD LEAD OUR WAY.  

01:02:01.140 --> 01:02:06.040
 THERE IS NOTHING THAT WE CAN'T DO, NO,  

01:02:06.070 --> 01:02:09.090
 THERE IS NOTHING WE CAN'T FACE.  

01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:11.280
 WE GOT TO COME TOGETHER.  

01:02:12.010 --> 01:02:14.180
 IS THERE ANY WAY WE CAN MAKE IT ALL RIGHT?  

01:02:14.210 --> 01:02:18.130
 WE'VE GOT TO PRAY TO WEATHER THROUGH ALL OF THE STORMS.  

01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:19.070
LET'S GO! 

01:02:19.100 --> 01:02:20.150
LET'S GO! 

01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:22.100
LET'S GO ROLL THROUGH THERE LIKE YOU STOLE SOMETHIN'! 

01:02:22.130 --> 01:02:23.140
COME ON NOW. 

01:02:23.170 --> 01:02:24.140
COME ON, BROCK. 

01:02:24.170 --> 01:02:25.150
COME ON, SON. 

01:02:25.180 --> 01:02:26.200
I WANT TO SEE SOME HITTIN'! 

01:02:26.230 --> 01:02:27.210
I WANT TO SEE SOME HITTIN'! 

01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:28.210
DIG THOSE FEET! 

01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:30.040
COME ON, YOU AIN'T ON MY TEAM YET!

OF THE G.I.S.A. FOOTBALL PLAYOFFS.

 ALL RIGHT, HUDDLE UP,  HUDDLE UP! 

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:57.060
STAY SHARP, STAY FOCUSED. 

01:08:57.090 --> 01:08:58.130
PLAY HARD AND HONOR GOD. 

01:08:58.160 --> 01:08:59.130
EAGLES ON THREE. 

01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:00.170
ONE, TWO, THREE! 

01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:02.090
EAGLES! 

01:09:03.210 --> 01:09:05.060

01:09:45.170 --> 01:09:49.260
THE PRINCETON HEIGHTS PANTHERS TAKE IT TO THE SHILOH EAGLES. 

01:09:49.290 --> 01:09:54.080
I KNEW WE WERE GONNA GET KILLED TONIGHT. 

01:10:05.180 --> 01:10:07.160
YOUR EFFORT WAS GOOD TONIGHT. 

01:10:07.190 --> 01:10:11.010
YOU'VE GOT NOTHING TO BE ASHAMED OF. 

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.070
YOU PLAYED HARD. 

01:10:16.100 --> 01:10:18.280
SHILOH'S HAD THE BEST SEASON THEY'VE HAD IN A LONG TIME. 

01:10:19.010 --> 01:10:24.020
GOD'S BEEN GOOD TO US THIS YEAR. 

01:10:28.060 --> 01:10:30.230
GUYS, COACH IS RIGHT. 

01:10:30.260 --> 01:10:32.280
WE GOTTA PRAISE GOD WHEN WE WIN, 

01:10:33.010 --> 01:10:36.210
WE'RE GONNA PRAISE HIM WHEN WE LOSE. 

01:10:37.120 --> 01:10:40.100
LET'S TAKE A KNEE. 

01:10:54.250 --> 01:10:56.120
HEY. 

01:10:56.150 --> 01:10:59.140
HEY. 

01:11:01.240 --> 01:11:06.010
I WISH BY SOME MIRACLE, WE COULD HAVE WON TONIGHT. 

01:11:06.050 --> 01:11:12.000
THEY WORKED TOO HARD TO WALK AWAY WITH THEIR HEADS DOWN. 

01:11:12.030 --> 01:11:18.250
I WAS HOPING GOD WOULD GIVE US JUST ONE WIN IN THE PLAYOFFS. 

01:11:18.280 --> 01:11:23.230
THEY DESERVED IT. 

01:11:29.210 --> 01:11:32.090
YOU KNOW, IF YOU'D HAVE TOLD ME 2 MONTHS AGO THAT WE'D BE 

01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:34.180
PLAYING PRINCETON HEIGHTS IN THE PLAYOFFS, 

01:11:34.210 --> 01:11:36.040
I WOULD NOT HAVE BELIEVED YOU. 

01:11:36.070 --> 01:11:37.130
YEAH. 

01:11:37.140 --> 01:11:38.210
IF YOU WOULD HAVE TOLD ME OUR SCHOOL WAS HAVING REVIVAL 

01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:40.200
THIS YEAR, I WOULDN'T HAVE BELIEVED YOU EITHER, 

01:11:40.230 --> 01:11:42.060
BUT THIS AIN'T BEEN A BAD YEAR. 

01:11:42.090 --> 01:11:43.170

01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:44.240

01:11:44.270 --> 01:11:46.170
I AIN'T READY TO PUT 'EM UP THOUGH. 

01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:48.050
I'M READY TO GO ANOTHER ROUND. 

01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:49.230
YOU AND ME BOTH. 

01:11:49.260 --> 01:11:51.060
PART OF ME WANTED TO GET TO STATE. 

01:11:51.090 --> 01:11:52.140
TO STATE? 

01:11:52.170 --> 01:11:53.240
GRANT ARE YOU SERIOUS? 

01:11:53.270 --> 01:11:54.240
WHY NOT? 

01:11:54.270 --> 01:11:55.290
AS HARD AS THEY WORKED. 

01:11:56.020 --> 01:11:57.050
WELL, WORKING HARD IS ONE THING, 

01:11:57.080 --> 01:11:58.290
BUT TO TAKE THIS TEAM TO STATE. 

01:11:59.020 --> 01:12:00.130
THAT'D TAKE AN ACT OF GOD. 

01:12:00.160 --> 01:12:02.180
HAS HE NOT BEEN ACTING ALREADY? 

01:12:02.210 --> 01:12:03.290
WELL, YEAH, HE HAS, BUT DO YOU KNOW 

01:12:04.020 --> 01:12:06.150
WHO'S GONNA BE WAITING FOR WHOEVER GETS TO STATE? 

01:12:06.180 --> 01:12:07.260
THE RICHLAND GIANTS. 

01:12:07.290 --> 01:12:09.090
THAT'S RIGHT, THE RICHLAND GIANTS. 

01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:11.290
AND BOBBY LEE DUKE WOULD BE THERE WITH HIS 85 PLAYERS READY 

01:12:12.020 --> 01:12:15.260
TO SPANK WHOEVER MADE IT TO THE STATE PLAYOFFS TO KINGDOM COME. 

01:12:15.290 --> 01:12:17.210
I'M NOT AFRAID. 

01:12:17.240 --> 01:12:20.030
I KNOW YOU'RE NOT AFRAID 'CAUSE YOU AIN'T GOIN'. 

01:12:20.060 --> 01:12:23.090
OH, BY THE WAY, MAN, SOME MAN CALLED LOOKIN' FOR YOU TODAY. 

01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:24.140
WHO? 

01:12:24.170 --> 01:12:27.030
UM, STAN SCHULTZ. 

01:12:27.060 --> 01:12:28.120
STAN SCHULTZ? 

01:12:28.150 --> 01:12:29.270
YEAH. 

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.150
STAN SCHULTZ, ISN'T THAT THE CARTOONIST? 

01:12:32.180 --> 01:12:34.130
 THAT'S CHARLES SCHULTZ. 

01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:36.220
NO, I THOUGHT CHARLES SCHULTZ WAS THAT MAN THAT FLEW 

01:12:36.250 --> 01:12:39.120
ACROSS THE OCEAN IN THE SPIRIT OF ST. ANDREWS. 

01:12:39.150 --> 01:12:42.140
THAT'S CHARLES LINDBERG, AND IT WAS THE SPIRIT OF ST. LOUIS. 

01:12:42.170 --> 01:12:44.120
NAH, LINDBERG IS THE CHEESE. 

01:12:44.150 --> 01:12:47.030
 LIMBURGER'S THE CHEESE,  LINDBERG'S THE MAN. 

01:12:47.060 --> 01:12:49.030
NO, THE LIMBURG WAS THAT BLIMP THAT BLEW UP 

01:12:49.060 --> 01:12:52.160
AND KILLED ALL THEM PEOPLE. 

01:12:52.190 --> 01:12:55.220
THAT'S THE HINDENBURG. 

01:12:58.060 --> 01:13:01.150
NAH, HINDENBURG IS WHERE YOU GO SKIING IN TENNESSEE. 

01:13:01.180 --> 01:13:02.280
 THAT'S GATLINBURG. 

01:13:03.010 --> 01:13:04.020
GATLINBURG? 

01:13:04.050 --> 01:13:05.220
YOU MEAN LIKE THE COUNTRY MUSIC GROUP, 

01:13:05.250 --> 01:13:08.250
THE GATLINBURG BROTHERS? 

01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:12.080
YOU GUYS ARE CRAZY. 

01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:15.230
 GRANT TAYLOR. 

01:13:15.260 --> 01:13:18.220
 WELL, MR. SCHULTZ, I WAS  TOLD YOU WERE LOOKING FOR ME. 

01:13:18.250 --> 01:13:20.220
 YES. 

01:13:20.250 --> 01:13:23.010
 AM I SITTING DOWN? 

01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:26.040
 WHY DO YOU ASK? 

01:13:26.290 --> 01:13:29.050
 HEY, COACH, WHAT'S  GOING ON HERE? 

01:13:29.080 --> 01:13:31.000
COACH IS ON HIS WAY TO LET US ALL KNOW. 

01:13:31.030 --> 01:13:33.130
ALL RIGHT. 

01:13:35.050 --> 01:13:38.220
ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY BRING IT IN. 

01:13:42.020 --> 01:13:44.030
I WANT YOU TO KNOW I SERVE A BIG GOD, 

01:13:44.060 --> 01:13:46.040
AND HE CAN DO WHATEVER HE WANTS TO DO. 

01:13:46.070 --> 01:13:47.210
HE CAN OPEN UP WHAT HE WANTS TO OPEN 

01:13:47.240 --> 01:13:49.100
AND SHUT WHAT HE WANTS TO SHUT. 

01:13:49.130 --> 01:13:51.010
AND A TEAM THAT PLAYS FOR HIS HONOR AND GLORY, 

01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:52.270
WILL HAVE HIS BLESSINGS FOLLOWING THAT TEAM, 

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.170
UNLIKE THOSE WHO TRY TO CHEAT THEIR WAY TO THE TOP 

01:13:55.200 --> 01:13:57.220
LIKE PRINCETON HEIGHTS DID IN LAST FRIDAY'S GAME 

01:13:57.250 --> 01:14:00.060
 WHEN THEY PLAYED  TWO INELIGIBLE 19-YEAR-OLDS. 

01:14:00.090 --> 01:14:02.010
THEY HAVE BEEN DISQUALIFIED, 

01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:03.270
AND WE'RE ADVANCING TO THE NEXT ROUND. 

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:05.180
GET YOUR PADS ON FOR PRACTICE, BOYS. 

01:14:05.210 --> 01:14:07.260
WE'RE GOING TO WAR WITH TUCKER FRIDAY NIGHT. 

01:14:07.290 --> 01:14:10.030
WHOO! 

01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:18.080
 WELCOME, LADIES  AND GENTLEMEN, 

01:14:18.110 --> 01:14:20.190
 TO THE G.I.S.A.  QUARTER FINALS. 

01:14:20.220 --> 01:14:22.230
WHO IS IN THE WORLD WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT WE'D BE SEEING 

01:14:22.260 --> 01:14:24.250
THE SHILOH EAGLES TONIGHT IN A CONTEST 

01:14:24.280 --> 01:14:26.120
AGAINST THE TUCKER TIGERS? 

01:14:26.150 --> 01:14:28.030
WELL, WITH PRINCETON HEIGHTS BEING DISQUALIFIED, 

01:14:28.060 --> 01:14:30.220
YOU CAN CALL THIS AN EARLY CHRISTMAS PRESENT FOR SHILOH. 

01:14:30.250 --> 01:14:32.110
OFFENSE, PUT IT IN THE END ZONE. 

01:14:32.140 --> 01:14:34.020
DEFENSE, BUILD ME A STONE WALL. 

01:14:34.050 --> 01:14:35.020
EAGLES ON THREE. 

01:14:35.050 --> 01:14:36.020
ONE, TWO, THREE! 

01:14:36.050 --> 01:14:38.070
EAGLES! 

01:14:40.190 --> 01:14:43.210
 BLUE 18, BLUE 18! 

01:14:43.240 --> 01:14:46.160
 SET, HUT-HUT! 

01:14:50.030 --> 01:14:56.260
 

01:15:09.050 --> 01:15:12.180
DAVID, THIS IS YOUR FIELD GOAL. 

01:15:12.210 --> 01:15:15.060
IT BELONGS TO YOU, PUT IT THROUGH. 

01:15:21.250 --> 01:15:23.170
 DAVID! 

01:15:25.070 --> 01:15:26.130
HUT! 

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.050
YEAH! 

01:15:32.080 --> 01:15:33.060
THERE YOU GO! 

01:15:33.090 --> 01:15:35.050
THERE YOU GO! 

01:15:35.090 --> 01:15:36.240
 WITH THE CLOCK RUNNING DOWN,  THE TUCKER TIGERS ARE NURSING 

01:15:36.270 --> 01:15:39.120
 THEIR WOUNDS AS THEY FACE  THE END OF THEIR SEASON. 

01:15:39.150 --> 01:15:42.200
 THE EAGLES HOWEVER, HAVE  A LITTLE FARTHER TO FLY. 

01:15:43.130 --> 01:15:46.020
ALL RIGHT, WHAT KIND OF SICK ARE WE TALKING ABOUT? 

01:15:46.050 --> 01:15:47.080
I DON'T KNOW. 

01:15:47.090 --> 01:15:48.290
I JUST FELT REALLY NAUSEOUS THE LAST TWO MORNING, 

01:15:49.020 --> 01:15:51.000
AND THEN I FEEL FINE AGAIN. 

01:15:51.030 --> 01:15:52.290
AND YOU HAVEN'T EATEN ANYTHING WEIRD LATELY. 

01:15:53.020 --> 01:15:56.110
NOT UNLESS FRUIT AND CEREAL'S WEIRD. 

01:15:56.140 --> 01:16:00.140
BROOKE, MY GUT SAYS MAKE AN APPOINTMENT WITH THE DOCTOR. 

01:16:00.170 --> 01:16:03.010
I'VE BEEN THERE THREE TIMES THIS YEAR. 

01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:05.010
IT'S GETTING EMBARRASSING. 

01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:06.230
I'M JUST TELLING YOU WHAT I WOULD DO. 

01:16:06.260 --> 01:16:09.260
YOU CAN EVEN USE MY CAR. 

01:16:13.060 --> 01:16:14.240
 WITH 5 SECONDS  LEFT IN THE GAME, 

01:16:14.270 --> 01:16:17.040
 THE SCORE STILL STANDS  IN OAK HAVEN'S FAVOR, 

01:16:17.070 --> 01:16:19.110
 17 TO 14 OVER  THE EAGLES. 

01:16:19.140 --> 01:16:21.130
 GRANT TAYLOR CALLS  A PLAY INTO ZACH AVERY, 

01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:22.240
 AND PULLS A HUDDLE TOGETHER 

01:16:22.270 --> 01:16:24.190
 FOR THEIR LAST SHOT  AT GOING TO STATE. 

01:16:24.220 --> 01:16:26.100
 IT'S THIRD DOWN IN  GOAL FOR THE EAGLES 

01:16:26.130 --> 01:16:28.030
 AND THE CROWD  IS GOING CRAZY. 

01:16:28.060 --> 01:16:29.230
 THEY LINE UP IN  AN I-FORMATION. 

01:16:29.260 --> 01:16:31.220
 THIS IS DO OR DIE  FOR THE EAGLES. 

01:16:31.250 --> 01:16:34.070
 ZACH TAKES A SNAP AND WILL  GIVE IT TO JACOB HOFFER-- 

01:16:34.100 --> 01:16:35.200
 NO WAIT A MINUTE, IT'S A FAKE! 

01:16:35.230 --> 01:16:37.080
 HE'S GOT NATHAN WIDE  OPEN IN THE CORNER. 

01:16:37.110 --> 01:16:38.180
 THE PASS IS UP. 

01:16:38.210 --> 01:16:39.180
 HE'S GOT IT. 

01:16:39.210 --> 01:16:41.030
 TOUCHDOWN EAGLES! 

01:16:41.060 --> 01:16:42.210
 TOUCHDOWN EAGLES! 

01:16:42.240 --> 01:16:45.070
 ZACH AVERY COMPLETELY FAKED  OUT THE DEFENSE AND MADE 

01:16:45.100 --> 01:16:47.240
 A PERFECT PASS TO WIN  THE GAME 20 TO 17! 

01:16:47.270 --> 01:16:49.130
 CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS? 

01:16:49.160 --> 01:16:52.010
 THE SHILOH EAGLES ARE  ACTUALLY HEADED TO 

01:16:52.040 --> 01:16:53.170
 THE STATE CHAMPIONSHIP! 

01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:56.240
 A TEAM WITH ONLY 32 PLAYERS  HAS MADE IT TO THE BIG DANCE! 

01:16:56.270 --> 01:16:58.260
 OH, MY! 

01:16:58.290 --> 01:17:01.030
ON THE EVE OF THE G.I.S.A. HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL STATE 

01:17:01.060 --> 01:17:03.170
CHAMPIONSHIP, THE RICHLAND GIANTS REPAIR TO DEFEND 

01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:06.090
THEIR 3-YEAR REIGN AS LORDS OF THE GRIDIRON. 

01:17:06.120 --> 01:17:08.150
IT'S NO SURPRISE THEY'VE RETURNED FOR THIS GAME. 

01:17:08.180 --> 01:17:10.220
WHAT IS SURPRISING IS WHO THEY'RE PLAYING, 

01:17:10.250 --> 01:17:14.090
THE SHILOH EAGLES WHO STARTED THE SEASON 0 AND 3 HAVE COME OUT 

01:17:14.120 --> 01:17:17.260
OF NOWHERE AND THROUGH AN ALMOST BIZARRE SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES, 

01:17:17.290 --> 01:17:20.210
NOW FACE A TEAM ALMOST THREE TIMES THEIR SIZE. 

01:17:23.030 --> 01:17:27.230
 

01:17:30.070 --> 01:17:32.140
SLEEP AT ALL LAST NIGHT? 

01:17:32.170 --> 01:17:34.230
MMM-MMM. 

01:17:34.260 --> 01:17:36.230
ARE YOU NERVOUS? 

01:17:36.260 --> 01:17:38.200
IT'S A WEIRD EMOTION. 

01:17:38.230 --> 01:17:42.200
PART OF ME THINKS WE'RE GONNA GET CRUSHED TONIGHT. 

01:17:42.230 --> 01:17:45.190
PART OF ME THINKS GOD MAY DO SOMETHING AWESOME. 

01:17:45.220 --> 01:17:49.200
SOUNDS LIKE YOUR FEAR'S ABOUT TO COLLIDE WITH YOUR FATE. 

01:17:49.230 --> 01:17:51.020
HMM. 

01:17:51.050 --> 01:17:53.070
SOMETHING LIKE THAT. 

01:17:53.100 --> 01:17:55.080
WHEN YOU GOING OUT THERE? 

01:17:55.110 --> 01:17:57.180
I MIGHT LEAVE EARLY IF THAT'S ALL RIGHT. 

01:17:57.210 --> 01:17:59.180
YEAH, JUST DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME. 

01:17:59.210 --> 01:18:01.070
I'LL JUST MEET YOU AT THE GAME. 

01:18:01.100 --> 01:18:04.080
OKAY. 

01:18:04.110 --> 01:18:06.180
EITHER WAY YOU'RE STILL PLAYING FOR 

01:18:06.210 --> 01:18:09.280
A STATE CHAMPIONSHIP. 

01:18:10.010 --> 01:18:12.140
HMM. 

01:18:17.260 --> 01:18:24.130
 

01:18:28.130 --> 01:18:31.100
 APPLE. 

01:18:31.130 --> 01:18:33.050
 WHERE'S THE DUCK? 

01:18:33.080 --> 01:18:34.070
 DUCK. 

01:18:34.100 --> 01:18:35.150
 ZEBRA. 

01:18:35.180 --> 01:18:36.250
 ZEB-A. 

01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:38.210
 CAT. 

01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:40.260
 DAC. 

01:18:40.290 --> 01:18:42.210
 MEOW? 

01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:44.110
 THERE'S A PIG. 

01:18:44.140 --> 01:18:46.010
BROOKE TAYLOR'S HERE AGAIN. 

01:18:46.040 --> 01:18:47.010
 AW. 

01:18:47.040 --> 01:18:48.270
MAYBE SHE'LL BE PREGNANT THIS TIME. 

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.220
I HOPE SO. 

01:18:53.270 --> 01:18:55.240
 YOU READY, SON? 

01:18:55.270 --> 01:18:57.080
I CAN'T FIND MY CLEATS. 

01:18:57.110 --> 01:18:59.050
 THEY'RE RIGHT  HERE BY THE DOOR. 

01:18:59.080 --> 01:19:02.010
OH, THANKS. 

01:19:04.040 --> 01:19:07.220
YOU REALIZE YOU'RE PLAYING FOR THE STATE CHAMPIONSHIP TONIGHT? 

01:19:07.250 --> 01:19:09.140
I DON'T KNOW WHY I'M SO NERVOUS, 

01:19:09.170 --> 01:19:11.120
I'M NOT EVEN GONNA PLAY. 

01:19:11.150 --> 01:19:13.100
YOU KNOW I'M PROUD OF YOU, DON'T YOU? 

01:19:13.130 --> 01:19:14.220
YES, SIR. 

01:19:14.250 --> 01:19:16.080
 DON'T EVER DOUBT IT. 

01:19:16.110 --> 01:19:19.150
WHETHER YOU PLAY OR NOT, I'LL BE RIGHT THERE PRAYING FOR YA. 

01:19:19.180 --> 01:19:21.010
THANKS, DAD. 

01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:24.020
NOW LET'S GO PICK A FIGHT WITH SOME GIANTS. 

01:19:27.020 --> 01:19:28.290
HERE'S THE RESULTS FOR B. TAYLOR. 

01:19:29.020 --> 01:19:32.030
OH, I'LL TAKE THAT. 

01:19:33.230 --> 01:19:35.020
OH. 

01:19:35.050 --> 01:19:36.100
NEGATIVE? 

01:19:36.130 --> 01:19:38.250
YES. 

01:19:41.260 --> 01:19:48.130
 THE SECRET LIFE IS LETTING GO.  

01:19:48.160 --> 01:19:56.000
 THE SECRET OF LOVE IS LETTING IT SHOW.  

01:19:56.030 --> 01:20:02.290
 IN ALL THAT I DO, IN ALL THAT I SAY  

01:20:03.020 --> 01:20:10.070
 RIGHT HERE IN THIS MOMENT.  

01:20:10.100 --> 01:20:16.140
 THE POWER OF PRAYER IS IN A HUMBLE CRY.  

01:20:16.170 --> 01:20:24.010
 THE POWER OF CHANGE IS IN GIVING MY LIFE.  

01:20:24.040 --> 01:20:31.190
 AND LAYING IT DOWN, DOWN AT YOUR FEET.  

01:20:31.220 --> 01:20:42.210
 RIGHT HERE IN THIS MOMENT, TAKE MY HEART, TAKE MY SOUL.  

01:20:43.210 --> 01:20:48.120
I WILL STILL LOVE YOU, LORD. 

01:20:48.150 --> 01:20:50.270
I WILL STILL LOVE YOU. 

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:54.030
 AND LET ALL THAT IS WITHIN ME,  

01:20:54.060 --> 01:20:57.200
 LIFT UP TO YOU AND SAY,  

01:20:57.230 --> 01:21:07.170
 I AM YOURS AND YOURS ALONE, COMPLETELY.  

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:17.020
 THIS JOURNEY OF LIFE IS A SEARCH FOR TRUTH.  

01:21:17.050 --> 01:21:23.290
 THIS JOURNEY OF FAITH IS FOLLOWING YOU  

01:21:24.020 --> 01:21:27.200
 EVERY STEP OF THE WAY  

01:21:27.230 --> 01:21:36.100
 THROUGH THE JOY AND THE PAIN, RIGHT HERE IN HIS MOMENT.  

01:21:36.130 --> 01:21:43.000
 TAKE MY HEART, TAKE MY SOUL.  

01:21:43.030 --> 01:21:50.150
 I SURRENDER EVERYTHING TO YOUR CONTROL.  

01:21:50.180 --> 01:21:58.010
 AND LET ALL THAT IS WITHIN ME LIFT UP TO YOU AND SAY,  

01:21:58.040 --> 01:22:08.090
 I AM YOURS AND YOURS ALONE COMPLETELY.  

01:22:14.210 --> 01:22:17.230
ALL RIGHT, GOD, YOU GOT US HERE. 

01:22:17.260 --> 01:22:22.150
WHATEVER HAPPENS, MAY YOU GET THE GLORY. 

01:22:22.180 --> 01:22:24.120
WHEW! 

01:22:32.020 --> 01:22:34.090
HA, HA! 

01:22:34.120 --> 01:22:35.280
COACH, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? 

01:22:36.010 --> 01:22:37.160
GRANT, YOU'RE AT THE STATE CHAMPIONSHIP, 

01:22:37.190 --> 01:22:38.220
WHAT DO YOU THINK I'M DOING HERE? 

01:22:38.250 --> 01:22:40.110
ANYTIME A FORMER PLAYER WOULD GET THIS FAR, 

01:22:40.140 --> 01:22:41.160
YOU KNOW I'D BE THERE. 

01:22:41.190 --> 01:22:43.140
NO WAY-- THAT BLOWS ME AWAY. 

01:22:43.170 --> 01:22:45.210
WELL, HOW YOU FEELIN'? 

01:22:45.240 --> 01:22:47.150
I'M A BIT NERVOUS. 

01:22:47.180 --> 01:22:50.150
THIS CHAMPIONSHIP, IT'S KIND OF SURREAL FOR ME. 

01:22:50.180 --> 01:22:52.170
YEAH, WELL I CAN PROMISE YOU I DON'T CARE WHAT LEVEL OF BALL 

01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:54.020
YOU'RE COACHING, IT'S SURREAL 

01:22:54.050 --> 01:22:55.280
WHEN YOU MAKE IT TO CHAMPIONSHIP GAME. 

01:22:56.010 --> 01:22:58.100
AND GRANT, I CAN JUST TELL YOU I'M SO PROUD OF YOU 

01:22:58.130 --> 01:22:59.190
AND WHAT YOU'VE DONE. 

01:22:59.220 --> 01:23:02.060
I'VE BEEN READING ABOUT THE TEAM AND WHERE YOU'VE GONE. 

01:23:02.090 --> 01:23:04.130
AND MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE, I'M JUST PROUD OF THE FACT 

01:23:04.160 --> 01:23:06.230
THAT YOU FINALLY LEARNED HOW TO WIN THE BIG ONE. 

01:23:06.260 --> 01:23:08.130
WE HADN'T PLAYED THEM YET. 

01:23:08.160 --> 01:23:10.220
YOU WON THE BIG ONE WHEN YOU ACCEPTED CHRIST, 

01:23:10.250 --> 01:23:13.130
AND NOW AS YOU'RE TEACHING THESE GUYS AND MINISTER TO 'EM, 

01:23:13.160 --> 01:23:15.050
I THINK IT'S JUST FANTASTIC. 

01:23:15.080 --> 01:23:17.000
I GOT IT. 

01:23:17.030 --> 01:23:18.180
THESE PLAYERS GOT IT. 

01:23:18.210 --> 01:23:21.020
WELL, I CAN PROMISE YOU, WIN OR LOSE THIS GAME, 

01:23:21.050 --> 01:23:22.250
YOU GUYS ARE CHAMPIONS. 

01:23:22.280 --> 01:23:24.050
I APPRECIATE THAT. 

01:23:24.060 --> 01:23:26.060
BUT HEY, WHILE YOU'RE HERE, YOU MIGHT AS WELL WIN IT, HUH? 

01:23:26.090 --> 01:23:27.280
I'M GONNA TRY MY BEST. 

01:23:28.010 --> 01:23:30.190
YOU KNOW, THIS TEAM WE'RE PLAYING THEY'RE HUGE, 

01:23:30.220 --> 01:23:32.090
THEY'RE FAST, THEY'RE STRONG. 

01:23:32.120 --> 01:23:34.110
I JUST DON'T WANT MY PLAYERS TO BE AFRAID. 

01:23:34.140 --> 01:23:39.010
WELL, IN GOD'S WORD HE SAID 365 DIFFERENT TIMES, 

01:23:39.040 --> 01:23:40.210
"DO NOT FEAR." 

01:23:40.240 --> 01:23:41.280
NOW IF HE SAYS IT THAT MANY TIMES, 

01:23:42.010 --> 01:23:44.150
YOU KNOW HE'S SERIOUS ABOUT IT, DON'T YOU? 

01:23:44.180 --> 01:23:45.190
I WOULD GUESS SO. 

01:23:45.220 --> 01:23:47.000
I NEEDED TO HEAR THAT. 

01:23:47.030 --> 01:23:48.260
WELL LOOK, YOU'RE GONNA DO GREAT TONIGHT. 

01:23:48.290 --> 01:23:50.010
I KNOW YOU'RE BUSY. 

01:23:50.040 --> 01:23:51.210
I'M A GO UP IN THOSE STANDS AND CHEER YOU ON. 

01:23:51.240 --> 01:23:52.210
GOOD TO SEE YA. 

01:23:52.240 --> 01:23:54.110
ALL RIGHT, GOD BLESS YOU, MAN. 

01:23:54.140 --> 01:23:56.040
THANKS, COACH. 

01:24:12.230 --> 01:24:15.280
IN ABOUT 5 MINUTES, WE HEAD OUT FOR THE WARM-UP. 

01:24:16.010 --> 01:24:18.240
I WANT TO SAY TWO THINGS. 

01:24:18.270 --> 01:24:22.110
NUMBER ONE, I LOVE YOU, AND I'M PROUD OF YOU. 

01:24:22.140 --> 01:24:26.010
 I WOULDN'T TRADE THIS SEASON  FOR ANYTHING IN THE WORLD. 

01:24:26.040 --> 01:24:28.090
SECONDLY, YOU'RE ABOUT TO PLAY THE BIGGEST TEAM 

01:24:28.120 --> 01:24:30.010
YOU'VE EVER FACED. 

01:24:30.040 --> 01:24:34.110
THEY'RE STRONG, FAST AND UNDEFEATED, 

01:24:34.140 --> 01:24:36.270
SO FAR. 

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.160
 BUT I WANT YOU TO REMEMBER  WHERE GOD HAS BROUGHT US. 

01:24:39.190 --> 01:24:42.050
 I WANT YOU TO REMEMBER  HOW HARD YOU'VE WORKED. 

01:24:42.080 --> 01:24:47.000
 WE WEREN'T SUPPOSED TO HAVE  A WINNING SEASON, BUT WE DO. 

01:24:47.030 --> 01:24:50.100
 WE WEREN'T SUPPOSED TO ADVANCE  TO THE PLAYOFFS, BUT WE DID. 

01:24:50.130 --> 01:24:54.000
WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE HERE, BUT WE ARE. 

01:24:54.030 --> 01:24:55.240
SO IF THERE'S ANYTHING IN YOU THAT SAYS 

01:24:55.270 --> 01:24:58.040
THIS IS A LOSING EFFORT, THROW IT OUT. 

01:24:58.070 --> 01:25:00.130
 'CAUSE AS I STAND HERE,  I BELIEVE THAT AS LONG AS 

01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:07.040
WE HONOR GOD, NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE, NOTHING. 

01:25:07.070 --> 01:25:09.100
 LEAVE EVERYTHING  OUT ON THE FIELD. 

01:25:09.130 --> 01:25:12.120
 GIVE YOUR BEST  TO GOD TONIGHT. 

01:25:12.150 --> 01:25:15.140
 AND WHETHER WE LEAVE THE  FIELD WITH VICTORS OR NOT, 

01:25:15.170 --> 01:25:17.280
WE WILL GIVE GOD THE GLORY. 

01:25:18.010 --> 01:25:23.240
NOW, WHO WILL GO FIGHT THE GIANTS WITH ME? 

01:25:29.240 --> 01:25:37.070
 

01:25:50.270 --> 01:25:53.120
YOU'VE GOTTA BE KIDDING ME. 

01:26:11.150 --> 01:26:13.220
 THE GIANTS ELECT TO RECEIVE  AFTER WINNING THE COIN TOSS, 

01:26:13.250 --> 01:26:14.280
 AND WE'RE JUST SECONDS AWAY 

01:26:15.010 --> 01:26:16.200
 FROM THE STATE CHAMPIONSHIP  FOOTBALL GAME. 

01:26:16.230 --> 01:26:17.280
 DALE, I GOTTA TELL  YOU SOMETHING. 

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:19.280
 IT IS IMPRESSIVE THAT  SHILOH HAS MADE IT THIS FAR, 

01:26:20.010 --> 01:26:22.100
BUT THE FIELD TONIGHT REALLY LOOKS LOPSIDED. 

01:26:22.130 --> 01:26:23.170
IT DEFINITELY DOES. 

01:26:23.200 --> 01:26:26.080
I'M LOOKING AT 85 PLAYERS ON THE RICHLAND SIDELINES 

01:26:26.110 --> 01:26:28.090
AS OPPOSED TO 32 FOR SHILOH. 

01:26:28.120 --> 01:26:29.270
EVEN IF THE EAGLES HAD GREAT TALENT, 

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.180
THEY CAN'T BRING IN FRESH PLAYERS LIKE THE GIANTS CAN. 

01:26:32.210 --> 01:26:34.270
THAT'S REALLY GONNA HURT 'EM IN THE SECOND HALF. 

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.130
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO JOSHUA! 

01:26:39.150 --> 01:26:42.130
 THE EAGLES KICK IT OFF, AND  THE STATE CHAMPIONSHIP GAME 

01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:45.000
 IS UNDERWAY; JARED HOUSE  WILL RECEIVE THE KICK, 

01:26:45.030 --> 01:26:46.120
 AND HE'LL HEAD DOWN  IN THE FIELD. 

01:26:46.150 --> 01:26:47.290
 HE GETS A COUPLE OF  BLOCKS AND BREAKS OUTSIDE. 

01:26:48.020 --> 01:26:49.100
 HE'S GOT SOME DAYLIGHT. 

01:26:49.110 --> 01:26:50.270
 BUT THE EAGLES WILL GIVE CHASE  AND THEY'LL TAKE HIM DOWN 

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
 AROUND THE 50-YARD LINE,  AND THAT'S WHERE 

01:26:53.030 --> 01:26:54.130
 THE GIANTS WILL  SET UP SHOP TONIGHT. 

01:26:54.160 --> 01:26:56.130
 FIRST DOWN IN TEN WITH GOOD  FIELD POSITION TO START 

01:26:56.160 --> 01:26:58.250
THIS STATE CHAMPIONSHIP FOOTBALL GAME. 

01:26:58.280 --> 01:27:01.170
GET OUT THERE! 

01:27:01.200 --> 01:27:04.030
COME ON, LET'S GO, BOYS! 

01:27:04.060 --> 01:27:05.290
 LESS PORTER WILL CALL  THE PLAY FOR THE GIANTS, 

01:27:06.020 --> 01:27:07.120
 AND HE STEPS BACK TO PASS. 

01:27:07.150 --> 01:27:09.100
 HE'S GOT DAMIAN FULLER  STREAKING DOWN THE SIDELINE 

01:27:09.130 --> 01:27:10.210
 AND HE LETS IT FLY. 

01:27:10.240 --> 01:27:12.020
 FULLER WILL TAKE  THE PASS IN. 

01:27:12.050 --> 01:27:13.220
 HE'LL RACE IN THE  END ZONE UNTOUCHED, 

01:27:13.250 --> 01:27:16.160
 AND THE GIANTS STRIKE EARLY  HERE IN THE FOOTBALL GAME 

01:27:16.190 --> 01:27:17.280
WITH THE FIRST SCORE. 

01:27:18.010 --> 01:27:20.130
WELCOME TO STATE CHAMPIONSHIP FOOTBALL. 

01:27:20.160 --> 01:27:22.120
HEY, MAN, THIS IS A WHOLE NEW LEVEL. 

01:27:22.150 --> 01:27:23.160
THEY ARE QUICK OFF THE LINE. 

01:27:23.190 --> 01:27:24.160
WE'VE GOTTA STAY FURTHER BACK. 

01:27:24.190 --> 01:27:25.230
I KNOW I'LL ADJUST. 

01:27:25.240 --> 01:27:27.280
 THE EAGLES START THIS  DRIVE AT THE 19-YARD LINE. 

01:27:28.010 --> 01:27:30.180
ZACH AVERY DROPS BACK TO PASS, AND HE PASSES TO JEREMY JOHNSON 

01:27:30.210 --> 01:27:33.090
 BUT THE PASS IS BATTED  DOWN BY THE GIANTS. 

01:27:33.120 --> 01:27:34.070
THAT'S RIGHT! 

01:27:34.100 --> 01:27:35.270
THAT'S THE WAY WE DO IT! 

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.160
AVERY HANDS IT TO JACOB PAUL WHO TRIES TO RUN UP THE MIDDLE, 

01:27:38.190 --> 01:27:44.280
 BUT HE GETS ABSOLUTELY NOWHERE  AS HE IS SWAMPED BY DEFENDERS. 

01:27:48.060 --> 01:27:51.020
SET, HUT-HUT! 

01:27:51.050 --> 01:27:53.120
 THE EAGLES LOOK TO PASS,  BUT HERE COME THE GIANTS 

01:27:53.150 --> 01:27:55.170
 AND THEY'RE GONNA GET THE  SACK AND THAT'S GONNA FORCE 

01:27:55.200 --> 01:27:58.060
 THE EAGLES INTO A PUNTING  SITUATION ON FOURTH DOWN. 

01:27:58.090 --> 01:28:00.270
WHOO, BABY THAT'S PRETTY! 

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:02.230
WHOO! 

01:28:05.070 --> 01:28:06.290
 JARED HOUSE WILL  RECEIVE THE KICK, 

01:28:07.020 --> 01:28:08.140
 AND HE'LL HEAD  DOWN THE FIELD. 

01:28:08.170 --> 01:28:09.290
 HE GETS A COUPLE OF  BLOCKS AND BREAKS OUTSIDE. 

01:28:10.020 --> 01:28:12.130
 HE'S GOT SOME DAYLIGHT. 

01:28:24.120 --> 01:28:29.120
 

01:28:33.280 --> 01:28:35.080
ALL RIGHT, REF! 

01:28:35.110 --> 01:28:37.100
TIME OUT. 

01:28:37.130 --> 01:28:39.180
 AFTER GAINING 8 YARDS,  THE EAGLES GIVE UP ANOTHER 

01:28:39.210 --> 01:28:41.270
SACK AND THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO PUNT IT AWAY ON FOURTH DOWN. 

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.070
DALE, SO FAR TONIGHT, IT'S BEEN ALL RICHLAND. 

01:28:44.100 --> 01:28:45.120
ZACH, THAT WAS MY FAULT. 

01:28:45.150 --> 01:28:46.170
I SHOULD NOT HAVE CALLED THAT PLAY. 

01:28:46.200 --> 01:28:47.170
COACH, THEY'RE ALL OVER US. 

01:28:47.200 --> 01:28:48.170
NOBODY'S OPEN. 

01:28:48.200 --> 01:28:49.190
THEY'RE KNOCKING US AROUND OUT THERE. 

01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:51.050
I KNOW THEY ARE, BUT THEY'RE GETTING COCKY. 

01:28:51.080 --> 01:28:52.190
WE CANNOT LET THEM PLAY THEIR GAME. 

01:28:52.220 --> 01:28:54.080
DEFENSE, I WANT YOU TO BLITZ ON FIRST DOWN. 

01:28:54.110 --> 01:28:55.210
WE'VE GOTTA GET THEM OFF THEIR RHYTHM. 

01:28:55.240 --> 01:28:57.170
LET'S GO! 

01:28:58.240 --> 01:29:03.250
 

01:29:24.160 --> 01:29:28.010
NO! 

01:29:37.130 --> 01:29:38.210
LET'S GO! LET'S GO! 

01:29:38.240 --> 01:29:41.180
LET'S GO! LET'S GO! 

01:29:42.230 --> 01:29:44.020
WHAT UNIVERSE ARE YOU IN? 

01:29:44.050 --> 01:29:46.170
GET IN THE GAME! 

01:29:50.150 --> 01:29:52.000
 SO WITH A FEW SECONDS  LEFT IN THE FIRST HALF, 

01:29:52.030 --> 01:29:54.260
IT LOOKED AS IF THE GIANTS WERE GONNA TAKE A 3 TOUCHDOWN LEAD. 

01:29:54.290 --> 01:29:56.170
BUT AFTER AN EAGLES' INTERCEPTION, 

01:29:56.200 --> 01:29:59.260
WE'VE GOT A 14 TO 7 FOOTBALL GAME. 

01:30:03.250 --> 01:30:06.010
WE CAN'T KEEP RUNNING ON NORMAL PLAYS, MAN, 

01:30:06.040 --> 01:30:07.240
THE DEFENSE IS KILLING US. 

01:30:07.270 --> 01:30:08.280
I AGREE. 

01:30:08.290 --> 01:30:12.050
WE CANNOT OUTMUSCLE 'EM AND WE CANNOT OUT RUN 'EM. 

01:30:12.080 --> 01:30:13.290
WE GOTTA OUTSMART 'EM. 

01:30:14.020 --> 01:30:16.040
TRICK PLAYS? 

01:30:16.070 --> 01:30:18.010
JUST ENOUGH TO KEEP 'EM GUESSING. 

01:30:18.040 --> 01:30:19.180
YOU SEE ANOTHER WAY? 

01:30:19.210 --> 01:30:21.100
WE JUST CAN'T USE 'EM TOO OFTEN THOUGH. 

01:30:21.130 --> 01:30:23.130
THEY CATCH ON, WE TOAST. 

01:30:23.160 --> 01:30:24.220
WE'RE TOAST ANYWAY IF WE DON'T PUT SOME POINTS 

01:30:24.250 --> 01:30:25.270
ON THAT BOARD. 

01:30:25.280 --> 01:30:27.060
WE HAVE GOTTA MAKE IT THROUGH THE FORTH QUARTER, 

01:30:27.090 --> 01:30:29.140
AND THEY GOT A DEEP BENCH. 

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:31.210
FIRST OF ALL, WE'RE STILL ON IN THIS GAME. 

01:30:31.240 --> 01:30:33.140
GOOD JOB ON THE DEFENSE GETTING US ON THE BOARD. 

01:30:33.170 --> 01:30:36.070
I BELIEVE THEY THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE A SHUT OUT. 

01:30:36.100 --> 01:30:37.200
WE'RE GONNA KEEP SURPRISING 'EM. 

01:30:37.230 --> 01:30:39.240
YOU FIGURED OUT THEY'VE GOT POWER AND SPEED? 

01:30:39.270 --> 01:30:43.170
THEY'RE BIG, BUT THEY'RE ALSO PREDICTABLE. 

01:30:43.200 --> 01:30:45.160
WE HAVE GOT TO STAY TOGETHER. 

01:30:45.190 --> 01:30:50.050
WE CAN'T OUTRUN 'EM, BUT WE CAN OUT SMART 'EM. 

01:30:50.270 --> 01:30:53.080
 WITH THE GIANTS LEADING  THE EAGLES 14 TO 7, 

01:30:53.110 --> 01:30:55.100
 WE GET SET TO BRING YOU  THE SECOND HALF OF THIS STATE 

01:30:55.130 --> 01:30:56.230
 CHAMPIONSHIP FOOTBALL GAME. 

01:30:56.260 --> 01:30:59.180
 AND UNLESS THE EAGLES CAN FIND  A WAY TO SOLVE RICHLAND'S SIZE 

01:30:59.210 --> 01:31:02.040
 AND STRENGTH, THE GIANTS CAN  VERY WELL BE TAKING HOME 

01:31:02.070 --> 01:31:05.040
THEIR FOURTH CONSECUTIVE STATE TITLE TONIGHT. 

01:31:11.040 --> 01:31:15.240
 

01:31:15.270 --> 01:31:17.080
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH! 

01:31:17.110 --> 01:31:19.180
AND THE EAGLES COME OUT WITH A LITTLE TRICKERY, 

01:31:19.210 --> 01:31:23.150
AND THEY'RE JUST ABOUT TO TIE THIS FOOTBALL GAME. 

01:31:31.140 --> 01:31:32.210
COME ON! COME ON! 

01:31:32.240 --> 01:31:33.280
LET'S GO! LET'S GO! 

01:31:34.010 --> 01:31:35.060
MAKE 'EM PAY, BOYS! 

01:31:35.090 --> 01:31:37.180
MAKE 'EM PAY! 

01:31:42.250 --> 01:31:45.080
THAT WAS DIRTY! 

01:31:47.220 --> 01:31:50.110
HE'S HURT! HE'S HURT! 

01:31:55.240 --> 01:31:58.020
JOSHUA WEBSTER'S BEING HELPED OFF THE FIELD WITH WHAT WE HAVE 

01:31:58.050 --> 01:32:00.170
BEEN TOLD UP HERE IN THE PRESS BOX AS A BROKEN COLLAR BONE. 

01:32:00.200 --> 01:32:03.080
THAT CAME AFTER A LATE HIT BY THE GIANTS AFTER THE EAGLES 

01:32:03.110 --> 01:32:05.050
TIED THE GAME AT 14 A PIECE. 

01:32:05.080 --> 01:32:06.180
THAT WAS STUPID, THAT WAS DIRTY. 

01:32:06.210 --> 01:32:07.200
HEY, CALM DOWN. 

01:32:07.230 --> 01:32:08.200
THIS IS A NEW BALL GAME. 

01:32:08.230 --> 01:32:09.230
JOSHUA'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT. 

01:32:09.260 --> 01:32:12.020
DAVID, COME HERE. 

01:32:12.050 --> 01:32:13.140
 YOU'VE GOTTA COVER  FOR JOSHUA NOW. 

01:32:13.170 --> 01:32:14.190
I NEED A 110%, OKAY? 

01:32:14.220 --> 01:32:15.190
ALL RIGHT, COACH. 

01:32:15.220 --> 01:32:16.240
BE THE MAN. 

01:32:16.270 --> 01:32:18.220
LET'S GO! 

01:32:19.200 --> 01:32:24.200
 

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:34.240
 WELL, AFTER A LONG  DRIVE, THE GIANTS SCORED, 

01:32:34.270 --> 01:32:36.220
BUT THE EAGLES PREVENT THE 2-POINT CONVERSION 

01:32:36.250 --> 01:32:39.040
 LEAVING THIS A 20  TO 14 FOOTBALL GAME. 

01:32:39.070 --> 01:32:40.280
WHY ARE THEY EVEN ON THE SCOREBOARD! 

01:32:41.010 --> 01:32:42.250
THEY SHOULDN'T EVEN BE IN THIS GAME! 

01:32:42.280 --> 01:32:45.000
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE, YOU WILL REMEMBER TODAY! 

01:32:45.030 --> 01:32:47.250
I WANT YOU TO REMEMBER THAT YOU HELD NOTHING BACK! 

01:32:47.280 --> 01:32:49.030
 YOU DID NOT LOSE HEART! 

01:32:49.060 --> 01:32:50.100
 YOU DID NOT  STOP FIGHTING! 

01:32:50.130 --> 01:32:51.160
 YOU DID NOT QUIT! 

01:32:51.190 --> 01:32:54.020
THEY'RE LIKE LITTLE DOGS NIPPING AT YOUR HEELS! 

01:32:54.050 --> 01:32:57.040
NOW GET OUT THERE AND STOMP 'EM! 

01:33:00.260 --> 01:33:05.070
THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT, THAT'S MY DEFENSE! 

01:33:05.100 --> 01:33:07.070
 LET'S GO EAGLES! 

01:33:07.100 --> 01:33:09.150
 HE'S GOING FOR  A BOMB! 

01:33:14.100 --> 01:33:15.270
 WITH 7 MINUTES  LEFT ON THE CLOCK, 

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:17.170
 THE EAGLES HAVE SHOWN  THE DETERMINATION 

01:33:17.200 --> 01:33:19.100
 OF A SCHOOL  TWICE THEIR SIZE. 

01:33:19.130 --> 01:33:21.240
THE GIANTS WILL NOW ATTEMPT A 35-YARD FIELD GOAL 

01:33:21.270 --> 01:33:24.270
TO EXTEND THEIR LEAD. 

01:33:26.210 --> 01:33:28.210
THAT IS THE LAST TIME WE GO FOR A FIELD GOAL! 

01:33:28.240 --> 01:33:31.190
WE SHOULD BE IN THE END ZONE EVERY STINKIN' TIME! 

01:33:31.220 --> 01:33:33.080
DOUBLE FLEX LONG. 

01:33:33.110 --> 01:33:35.050
DOUBLE FLEX LONG. 

01:33:36.230 --> 01:33:43.260
 

01:34:01.090 --> 01:34:02.270
WHAT ARE YOU DOING! 

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:04.150
FIELD GOAL UNIT, COME ON, LET'S GO, LET'S GO! 

01:34:04.180 --> 01:34:07.070
FIELD GOAL UNIT, LET'S GO! 

01:34:09.110 --> 01:34:11.060
COACH, I NEED A REST. 

01:34:11.090 --> 01:34:12.170
I CAN'T GO MUCH MORE. 

01:34:12.200 --> 01:34:13.220
BROCK, I NEED YOU ON THAT FIELD. 

01:34:13.250 --> 01:34:14.260
YOU HAVE GOT TO STAY IN THE GAME. 

01:34:14.290 --> 01:34:16.090
I NEED YOU ON THE FIELD! 

01:34:16.120 --> 01:34:17.140
YES SIR. 

01:34:17.150 --> 01:34:19.090
DAVID CHILDERS IS IN TO KICK FOR JOSHUA WEBSTER. 

01:34:19.120 --> 01:34:21.230
 WE UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS  HIS FIRST SEASON OF FOOTBALL, 

01:34:21.260 --> 01:34:24.030
 AND HE'S GONE  3 FOR 4 THIS SEASON. 

01:34:24.060 --> 01:34:25.040
AND LOOKING AT THE STATS, 

01:34:25.060 --> 01:34:27.070
HE'S BEEN LIMITED TO SHORT-RANGE KICKS. 

01:34:27.100 --> 01:34:30.100
 COME ON, DAVID,  YOU GOT THIS. 

01:34:42.010 --> 01:34:47.010
 

01:34:49.020 --> 01:34:50.070
YEAH! 

01:34:54.290 --> 01:34:56.040
TIME OUT, REF. 

01:34:56.070 --> 01:34:58.090
REF, TIME OUT. 

01:34:59.020 --> 01:35:01.040
COACH, I'M DONE. 

01:35:01.070 --> 01:35:03.100
SOMEONE ELSE HAS GOTTA LEAD. 

01:35:03.130 --> 01:35:05.050
BROCK, THIS IS WHEN IT MATTERS MOST. 

01:35:05.080 --> 01:35:06.170
I KNOW YOU'RE TIRED. 

01:35:06.200 --> 01:35:08.050
IT'S EASY TO LEAD WHEN YOU'RE STRONG, 

01:35:08.080 --> 01:35:10.020
BUT NOW IS WHEN YOU LEAD US, RIGHT NOW! 

01:35:10.050 --> 01:35:11.260
CAN YOU GIVE ME FOUR MORE DOWNS? 

01:35:11.290 --> 01:35:14.260
I JUST NEED FOUR MORE DOWNS. 

01:35:14.290 --> 01:35:16.110
FOUR MORE. 

01:35:16.140 --> 01:35:17.110
ALL RIGHT, COME HERE! 

01:35:17.140 --> 01:35:18.110
COME HERE! 

01:35:18.140 --> 01:35:20.050
THIS IS OUR TIME AND YOU'VE GOT TO PUT 

01:35:20.080 --> 01:35:21.190
THE NAILS IN THE COFFIN! 

01:35:21.220 --> 01:35:22.280
LOOK AT ME, LOOK AT ME! 

01:35:23.010 --> 01:35:25.010
WE DIDN'T FIGHT THIS FAR TO GIVE UP IN THE LAST QUARTER. 

01:35:25.040 --> 01:35:26.230
YOU'VE GOTTA LEAVE EVERYTHING ON THE FIELD. 

01:35:26.260 --> 01:35:29.090
AND FIELD GOALS, THEY'RE NOT AN OPTION. 

01:35:29.120 --> 01:35:31.010
I NEED YOU FOR FOUR MORE DOWNS! 

01:35:31.040 --> 01:35:32.020
WHO'S WITH ME? 

01:35:32.050 --> 01:35:34.030
NOW GET OUT THERE AND GET IT DONE! 

01:35:34.060 --> 01:35:35.190
WITH LESS THAN 2 MINUTES LEFT ON THE CLOCK, 

01:35:35.220 --> 01:35:38.000
THE GIANTS STAND ON THE VERGE OF THEIR FOURTH STRAIGHT 

01:35:38.030 --> 01:35:40.000
CONSECUTIVE STATE TITLE. 

01:35:40.030 --> 01:35:44.030
 THE TIRED EAGLES TEAM LINES  UP TO FACE THEM YET AGAIN. 

01:35:46.290 --> 01:35:48.080
STONE WALL! 

01:35:48.110 --> 01:35:49.230
STONE WALL! 

01:35:49.260 --> 01:35:51.240
YES, STONE WALL! 

01:35:51.270 --> 01:35:52.230
STONE WALL! 

01:35:52.260 --> 01:35:53.130
STONE WALL! 

01:35:53.160 --> 01:35:54.250
STONE WALL! 

01:35:54.280 --> 01:35:56.150
STONE WALL! 

01:35:56.180 --> 01:35:57.290
 GIANTS LINE UP  FIRST AND GOAL. 

01:35:58.020 --> 01:36:01.010
 THIS SCORE WILL SOLIDIFY  THE STATE CHAMPIONSHIP. 

01:36:01.040 --> 01:36:03.090
 HAND THE BALL OFF--NO WAIT  A MINUTE, HE IS STOPPED! 

01:36:03.120 --> 01:36:04.220
 THE EAGLES ARE  STILL IN IT! 

01:36:04.250 --> 01:36:06.080
 THEY'RE STILL SHOWING  STRONG DETERMINATION 

01:36:06.110 --> 01:36:07.230
 TO FIGHT THIS ONE OUT! 

01:36:07.260 --> 01:36:10.130
THREE MORE DOWNS! 

01:36:10.160 --> 01:36:13.060
THREE MORE! 

01:36:13.090 --> 01:36:14.180
YOU GOTTA HANG WITH ME. 

01:36:14.210 --> 01:36:17.290
I KNOW IT'S GETTING TOUGH, BUT WE GOTTA STOP 'EM RIGHT HERE. 

01:36:18.020 --> 01:36:20.160
THE SECOND DOWN AND GOAL TO GO FOR THE GIANTS, 

01:36:20.190 --> 01:36:22.210
 THE STATE TITLE IS  WITHIN THEIR GRASP. 

01:36:22.240 --> 01:36:24.210
 BOTH OF THE STANDS ARE  ON THEIR FEET RIGHT NOW 

01:36:24.240 --> 01:36:26.100
 AS THEY GET READY  TO RUN THIS PLAY. 

01:36:26.130 --> 01:36:27.210
 THIS QUARTER  WILL TAKE IT. 

01:36:27.240 --> 01:36:28.290
 HE'S GONNA TRY  AND RUN IT, NO! 

01:36:29.020 --> 01:36:30.120
 THE EAGLES HAVE  STOPPED THEM AGAIN! 

01:36:30.150 --> 01:36:32.010
THAT'S MY TEAM! 

01:36:32.040 --> 01:36:35.070
THAT'S MY TEAM! 

01:36:36.260 --> 01:36:37.180
COME ON! 

01:36:37.210 --> 01:36:39.060
GET IN THE END ZONE! 

01:36:39.090 --> 01:36:40.100
TWO MORE! 

01:36:40.110 --> 01:36:42.250
 AND HERE WE GO AGAIN,  THEY'RE GONNA TEE IT UP 

01:36:42.280 --> 01:36:43.270
 AND TRY IT AGAIN. 

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:45.080
 WES PORTER WILL  TAKE THE SNAP. 

01:36:45.110 --> 01:36:46.220
 HE'S LOOKING TO PASS  INTO THE CORNER. 

01:36:46.250 --> 01:36:48.080
 HE'S GOT SOMEBODY  THERE BUT NO! 

01:36:48.110 --> 01:36:49.270
 THE EAGLES BAT  DOWN THE PASS, 

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:51.230
 AND THE CROWD IS  GOING NUTS RIGHT NOW. 

01:36:51.260 --> 01:36:54.050
 THE GIANTS ARE HAVE BEEN  KEPT OUT OF THE END ZONE 

01:36:54.080 --> 01:36:55.190
 BY THE EAGLES WITH THREE  STRAIGHT PLAYS. 

01:36:55.220 --> 01:36:58.070
AND NOW BOBBY LEE DUKE WILL HAVE A BIG DECISION TO MAKE. 

01:36:58.100 --> 01:37:00.070
COACH, WE HAVE GOTTA GO FOR A FIELD GOAL. 

01:37:00.100 --> 01:37:02.270
WE'RE NOT GOING FOR A FIELD GOAL! 

01:37:04.290 --> 01:37:06.000
HE'S NOT KICKIN'. 

01:37:06.030 --> 01:37:07.060
BROCK, BROCK! 

01:37:07.090 --> 01:37:08.160
ONE MORE DOWN! 

01:37:08.190 --> 01:37:10.180
ONE MORE DOWN! 

01:37:11.070 --> 01:37:14.030
IT'S FOURTH DOWN AND THE GIANTS ARE GOING FOR THE TOUCHDOWN. 

01:37:14.060 --> 01:37:16.220
 THIS CROWD IS GOING  ABSOLUTELY BERSERK RIGHT NOW. 

01:37:16.250 --> 01:37:18.130
 THEY LINE UP AT  THE 1-YARD LINE. 

01:37:18.160 --> 01:37:20.010
 WES PORTER'S GONNA  TAKE THE SNAP. 

01:37:20.040 --> 01:37:21.010
 THEY'RE GONNA RUN IT. 

01:37:21.040 --> 01:37:22.170
 BROCK KELLEY'S  GONNA MEET HIM HEAD ON. 

01:37:22.200 --> 01:37:23.200
 AND THERE'S A FUMBLE! 

01:37:23.230 --> 01:37:25.040
 THERE'S A FUMBLE! 

01:37:25.070 --> 01:37:26.220
 THE EAGLES HAVE  THE FOOTBALL. 

01:37:26.250 --> 01:37:28.130
 THEY'RE TAKING IT  BACK DOWN THE FIELD! 

01:37:28.160 --> 01:37:31.180
 HE'S AT THE 40, HE'S AT  THE 50, HE'S AT THE 40! 

01:37:31.210 --> 01:37:34.090
AND HE'LL BE RUN OUT OF BOUNDS IN THE 34-YARD LINE! 

01:37:34.120 --> 01:37:35.170
 ARE YOU BELIEVING THIS? 

01:37:35.200 --> 01:37:37.020
WITH 2 SECONDS LEFT ON THE CLOCK, 

01:37:37.050 --> 01:37:40.100
THE EAGLES HAVE GOT A SHOT IN THIS FOOTBALL GAME. 

01:37:45.210 --> 01:37:47.180
TWO SECONDS, GRANT, WE'VE GOT TIME FOR A HAIL MARY. 

01:37:47.210 --> 01:37:49.050
NO, NO, THE DEFENSE TOO STRONG FOR THE PASS. 

01:37:49.080 --> 01:37:50.100
NO, WE CAN'T RUN IT. 

01:37:50.130 --> 01:37:52.010
THAT'S OUR ONLY OPTION. 

01:37:52.040 --> 01:37:54.050
YOU'VE GOTTA KICK IT, MAN. 

01:37:55.210 --> 01:37:57.280
DAVID, 

01:37:58.010 --> 01:37:59.100
I NEED A 51-YARD FIELD GOAL. 

01:37:59.130 --> 01:38:00.250
COACH, I CAN'T KICK THAT FAR. 

01:38:00.280 --> 01:38:02.200
DAVID, THEY'VE BEEN STOPPING THE RUN AT THE PASS ALL NIGHT. 

01:38:02.230 --> 01:38:03.250
YOU'RE MY BEST OPTION. 

01:38:03.260 --> 01:38:05.250
COACH, THE FARTHEST I'VE EVER KICKED IS A 39-YARDER. 

01:38:05.280 --> 01:38:07.290
THERE IS NO WAY I CAN KICK A 51-YARD FIELD GOAL. 

01:38:08.020 --> 01:38:09.090
I BELIEVE YOU CAN. 

01:38:09.120 --> 01:38:10.130
YOUR JOB IS TO DO THE BEST YOU CAN 

01:38:10.160 --> 01:38:11.190
AND LEAVE THE RESULTS UP TO GOD. 

01:38:11.220 --> 01:38:13.150
I NEED YOU ON THAT FIELD. 

01:38:13.180 --> 01:38:15.130
 ALL RIGHT,  FIELD GOAL UNIT. 

01:38:15.160 --> 01:38:17.010
GRANT, WE'VE GOTTA THROW IT. 

01:38:17.040 --> 01:38:18.050
HE CAN'T KICK IT FROM THERE. 

01:38:18.080 --> 01:38:19.010
IT'S TOO FAR. 

01:38:19.040 --> 01:38:20.010
NO, IT'S NOT. 

01:38:20.040 --> 01:38:21.160
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'? 

01:38:21.190 --> 01:38:23.240
I'M PREPARING FOR RAIN. 

01:38:24.030 --> 01:38:26.070
 I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS,  BUT WITH 2 SECONDS LEFT ON 

01:38:26.100 --> 01:38:28.060
THE CLOCK, COACH GRANT TAYLOR AND THE SHILOH EAGLES ARE 

01:38:28.090 --> 01:38:31.060
 PUTTING THE GAME IN THE HANDS  OF A 145-POUND BACK-UP KICKER. 

01:38:31.090 --> 01:38:33.120
 THIS IS NOT A GOOD MOVE  ON GRANT TAYLOR'S PART. 

01:38:33.150 --> 01:38:36.020
 HE EVEN HAS TO  KICK INTO THE WIND. 

01:38:38.200 --> 01:38:40.040
DAVID! 

01:38:40.070 --> 01:38:42.220
 DAVID! 

01:38:43.220 --> 01:38:44.240
HE'S NOT READY, GRANT. 

01:38:44.270 --> 01:38:45.240
HE DON'T THINK HE CAN DO IT. 

01:38:45.270 --> 01:38:48.120
I DON'T HAVE ANYMORE TIME OUTS. 

01:38:48.150 --> 01:38:50.040
CALL A TIME OUT, BOBBY LEE. 

01:38:50.070 --> 01:38:51.180
THIS KID CAN'T KICK THAT FAR. 

01:38:51.210 --> 01:38:53.050
CALL THAT TIME OUT. 

01:38:53.150 --> 01:38:56.120
CALL A TIME OUT ANYWAY, AND LET'S ICE HIM. 

01:39:01.170 --> 01:39:03.130
DAVID, COME HERE. 

01:39:04.120 --> 01:39:06.030
DAVID YOU'RE TELLING YOURSELF YOU'RE GONNA MISS THIS KICK. 

01:39:06.060 --> 01:39:07.120
COACH, IT'S TOO FAR. 

01:39:07.150 --> 01:39:11.170
LISTEN TO ME, DO YOU THINK GOD CAN HELP YOU MAKE THIS KICK? 

01:39:11.200 --> 01:39:12.240
DO YOU BELIEVE IT, DAVID? 

01:39:12.270 --> 01:39:14.100
YEAH, IF HE WANTS TO. 

01:39:14.130 --> 01:39:15.120
SO DO I. 

01:39:15.150 --> 01:39:16.190
BUT YOU HAVE GOT TO GIVE HIM YOUR BEST 

01:39:16.220 --> 01:39:17.190
AND LEAVE THE REST UP TO HIM. 

01:39:17.220 --> 01:39:19.230
WILL YOU DO THAT FOR ME? 

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:27.150
 

01:39:28.080 --> 01:39:29.180
DAVID, WHETHER YOU MAKE THIS FIELD GOAL OR NOT, 

01:39:29.210 --> 01:39:30.230
WE'RE GONNA PRAISE HIM. 

01:39:30.260 --> 01:39:31.280
BUT DON'T YOU WALK OFF THIS FIELD 

01:39:32.010 --> 01:39:34.220
HAVING DONE ANY LESS THAN YOUR BEST. 

01:39:35.220 --> 01:39:40.220
 

01:39:54.180 --> 01:39:55.140
CAN I HELP YA? 

01:39:55.170 --> 01:39:56.250
DON'T TOUCH ME. 

01:39:56.280 --> 01:39:59.070
I'M STANDING FOR MY SON. 

01:40:01.240 --> 01:40:04.280
GOD, HELP ME MAKE THIS KICK. 

01:40:09.210 --> 01:40:11.150
KICK IT NOW! 

01:40:11.180 --> 01:40:14.170
KICK IT NOW! 

01:40:17.240 --> 01:40:21.240
 

01:40:21.270 --> 01:40:22.210
 THE KICK IS UP. 

01:40:22.240 --> 01:40:23.190
 IT'S ON ITS WAY. 

01:40:23.220 --> 01:40:24.160
 IT'S LONG ENOUGH. 

01:40:24.190 --> 01:40:25.130
 IT'S HIGH ENOUGH. 

01:40:25.160 --> 01:40:26.110
 DOES IT HAVE THE DISTANCE? 

01:40:26.140 --> 01:40:27.050
 IT DOES! 

01:40:27.080 --> 01:40:27.270
 IT'S GOOD! 

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:28.190
 IT'S GOOD. 

01:40:28.220 --> 01:40:29.110
 IT'S GOOD! 

01:40:29.140 --> 01:40:30.140
 THE EAGLES HAVE WON! 

01:40:30.150 --> 01:40:31.200
 THE EAGLES HAVE WON  THE STATE CHAMPIONSHIP! 

01:40:31.230 --> 01:40:34.050
 I CAN'T BELIEVE  WHAT I JUST SEEN! 

01:40:34.080 --> 01:40:36.010
 I CANNOT BELIEVE  WHAT I'VE JUST SEEN! 

01:40:36.040 --> 01:40:37.270
A MIRACLE HAS OCCURRED HERE TONIGHT! 

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:42.150
THE SHILOH EAGLES HAVE DEFEATED THE RICHLAND GIANTS 24 TO 23 

01:40:42.180 --> 01:40:45.200
TO TAKE THE STATE TITLE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THEIR HISTORY! 

01:40:45.230 --> 01:40:46.280
 IT'S INCREDIBLE! 

01:40:47.010 --> 01:40:49.250
 IT'S ABSOLUTELY UNBELIEVABLE! 

01:40:51.070 --> 01:40:52.150
YOU ARE STATE CHAMPION! 

01:40:52.180 --> 01:40:55.010
YOU ARE STATE CHAMPION! 

01:41:02.140 --> 01:41:07.140
 

01:41:24.010 --> 01:41:27.150
HEY, WHO'S THE STATE CHAMPIONS? 

01:41:27.180 --> 01:41:32.290
WHOO! 

01:41:33.020 --> 01:41:39.120
OKAY, OKAY, I GOT SOMETHING TO SAY. 

01:41:39.150 --> 01:41:46.000
DAVID CHILDERS, 

01:41:46.030 --> 01:41:47.190
DON'T YOU EVER LET ANYONE TELL YOU 

01:41:47.220 --> 01:41:53.100
THAT YOU'RE UNDER PAR, SECOND RATE OR INFERIOR. 

01:41:53.130 --> 01:41:56.060
I JUST WATCHED GOD DO A MIRACLE THROUGH YOU, 

01:41:56.090 --> 01:42:00.070
AND I SAW A FIELD OF GIANTS, 85 OF 'EM TO BE EXACT, 

01:42:00.100 --> 01:42:02.050
FALL IN DEFEAT. 

01:42:02.090 --> 01:42:04.120
NOW YOU TELL ME WHAT'S IMPOSSIBLE WITH GOD. 

01:42:04.150 --> 01:42:07.200
NOTHING, COACH. 

01:42:07.230 --> 01:42:11.060
ZACH, I JUST WATCHED YOU AND THE OFFENSE DO 

01:42:11.090 --> 01:42:13.120
 WHAT THEY SAID  COULD NOT BE DONE. 

01:42:13.150 --> 01:42:15.070
 NOW YOU TELL ME WHAT'S  IMPOSSIBLE WITH GOD. 

01:42:15.100 --> 01:42:17.230
NOTHING, COACH. 

01:42:17.260 --> 01:42:19.140
BROCK, HOW ABOUT IT? 

01:42:19.170 --> 01:42:21.100
BUILT THAT STONE WALL, DIDN'T YA? 

01:42:21.130 --> 01:42:22.170
AND IT STOOD. 

01:42:22.200 --> 01:42:25.080
NOW YOU TELL ME WHAT'S IMPOSSIBLE WITH GOD. 

01:42:25.110 --> 01:42:26.240
NOTHING, COACH. 

01:42:26.270 --> 01:42:27.240
HOW ABOUT IT, SCOTT? 

01:42:27.270 --> 01:42:28.290
WHAT'S IMPOSSIBLE WITH GOD? 

01:42:29.020 --> 01:42:30.030
NOTHIN'. 

01:42:30.040 --> 01:42:31.030
 ARE YOU SURE 'CAUSE  THOSE GIANTS ARE BIG. 

01:42:31.060 --> 01:42:32.270
 THEY OUTNUMBER US 3 TO 1. 

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.060
 ARE YOU SURE THERE'S  NOTHING IMPOSSIBLE WITH GOD? 

01:42:35.090 --> 01:42:38.040
I'M SURE, COACH. 

01:42:38.070 --> 01:42:39.050
HOW ABOUT IT, NATHAN? 

01:42:39.080 --> 01:42:40.080
WHAT'S IMPOSSIBLE WITH GOD? 

01:42:40.110 --> 01:42:41.060
NOTHING, COACH. 

01:42:41.090 --> 01:42:42.110
JONATHAN? 

01:42:42.140 --> 01:42:43.230
NOTHIN'. 

01:42:43.260 --> 01:42:44.290
ARE YA POSITIVE? 

01:42:45.020 --> 01:42:46.170

01:42:46.200 --> 01:42:47.250
SO AM I. 

01:42:47.280 --> 01:42:49.180
SO AM I. 

01:42:49.210 --> 01:42:52.230
GOD CAN DO WHATEVER HE WANTS TO DO HOWEVER HE WANTS TO DO IT. 

01:42:52.260 --> 01:42:54.220
AND HE CHOOSES TO WORK IN OUR LIVES 

01:42:54.250 --> 01:42:57.040
'CAUSE HE LOVES US 'CAUSE HE'S GOOD. 

01:42:57.070 --> 01:43:00.060
I HOPE TODAY'S A MILESTONE FOR WHAT HE CAN DO 

01:43:00.090 --> 01:43:05.020
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE IF YOU TRUST HIM. 

01:43:05.050 --> 01:43:08.110
WE NEED TO SPEND SOME TIME THANKING HIM. 

01:43:25.080 --> 01:43:27.150
WELL, LOOK WHO JUST WALKED IN THIS HOUSE. 

01:43:27.180 --> 01:43:31.120
COULDN'T BE THE STATE CHAMPION COACH GRANT TAYLOR, COULD IT? 

01:43:31.150 --> 01:43:34.020
'CAUSE HE'S NOT SUPPOSED TO LIVE HERE. 

01:43:34.050 --> 01:43:38.120
HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE OUT LOOKING FOR A JOB. 

01:43:38.150 --> 01:43:41.150
YEAH, I DID IT, BROOKE. 

01:43:41.180 --> 01:43:46.190
HE DID IT. 

01:43:46.220 --> 01:43:53.020
HE GAVE ME THIS JOB, PROVIDED FOR OUR NEEDS, 

01:43:53.050 --> 01:43:56.120
TOOK AWAY MY FEAR. 

01:43:56.150 --> 01:44:02.140
HE THROWS IN THE STATE CHAMPIONSHIP JUST 'CAUSE HE CAN. 

01:44:05.260 --> 01:44:09.180
IT'S BEEN ONE OF THE BEST DAYS OF MY LIFE. 

01:44:09.210 --> 01:44:11.200
THE DAY'S NOT OVER YET. 

01:44:11.230 --> 01:44:14.220
WHAT DO YOU MEAN? 

01:44:14.250 --> 01:44:18.260
GRANT TAYLOR, I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW 

01:44:18.290 --> 01:44:21.010
THAT YOU'VE MADE THE TEAM. 

01:44:21.040 --> 01:44:25.170
WHAT TEAM? 

01:44:25.200 --> 01:44:29.070
THE DADDY TEAM. 

01:44:31.120 --> 01:44:33.180
WE'RE GONNA HAVE A BABY? 

01:44:33.210 --> 01:44:37.090
WE'RE GONNA HAVE A BABY. 

01:44:43.290 --> 01:44:49.070
YOU TELL ME, COACH TAYLOR, TELL ME WHAT'S IMPOSSIBLE 

01:44:49.100 --> 01:44:54.020
WHEN GOD'S ON YOUR SIDE. 

01:44:54.050 --> 01:44:56.030
OH, GOD. 

01:44:56.060 --> 01:44:57.050
OH, GOD. 

01:44:57.080 --> 01:44:59.170
I'M OVERWHELMED. 

01:45:01.210 --> 01:45:06.210
 

01:45:10.130 --> 01:45:13.270
 OH, WHAT I WOULD DO TO HAVE THE KIND OF STRENGTH  

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:18.180
 THAT TAKES THE STAND BEFORE A GIANT  

01:45:18.210 --> 01:45:21.220
 WITH JUST A SLING AND A STONE.  

01:45:21.250 --> 01:45:26.080
 SURROUNDED BY THE SOUND OF A THOUSAND WARRIORS  

01:45:26.110 --> 01:45:30.270
 SHAKING IN THEIR ARMOR, WISHING THEY'D HAVE HAD  

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.110
 THE STRENGTH TO STAND.  

01:45:33.140 --> 01:45:36.090
 BUT THE GIANTS CALLIN' OUT MY NAME  

01:45:36.120 --> 01:45:39.060
 AND HE LAUGHS AT ME.  

01:45:39.090 --> 01:45:41.290
 REMINDING ME OF ALL THE TIMES  

01:45:42.020 --> 01:45:45.020
 I TRIED BEFORE AND FAILED.  

01:45:45.050 --> 01:45:50.150
 THE GIANT KEEPS ON TELLING ME TIME AND TIME AGAIN,  

01:45:50.180 --> 01:45:53.250
 BOY, YOU'LL NEVER WIN.  

01:45:53.280 --> 01:45:57.280
 YOU'LL NEVER WIN.  

01:45:58.010 --> 01:46:04.210
 BUT THE VOICE OF TRUTH TELLS ME A DIFFERENT STORY.  

01:46:04.240 --> 01:46:09.240
 THE VOICE OF TRUTH SAYS, DO NOT BE AFRAID.  

01:46:09.270 --> 01:46:15.260
 AND THE VOICE OF TRUTH SAYS, THIS IS FOR MY GLORY.  

01:46:15.290 --> 01:46:21.030
 OUT OF ALL THE VOICES CALLING OUT TO ME,  

01:46:21.060 --> 01:46:27.180
 I WILL CHOOSE TO LISTEN AND BELIEVE.  

01:46:27.210 --> 01:46:35.090
 I WILL CHOOSE TO LISTEN AND BELIEVE THE VOICE OF TRUTH.  

01:46:41.230 --> 01:46:46.230
 

01:46:49.170 --> 01:46:56.240
 YOU HAVE BEEN SO GOOD TO ME.  

01:46:56.270 --> 01:47:04.120
 HOW CAN I FIND THE WORDS TO THANK YOU?  

01:47:04.150 --> 01:47:11.230
 HEALER OF BROKEN HEARTS AND BROKEN DREAMS.  

01:47:11.260 --> 01:47:18.020
 BUT LORD, I WILL NEVER CEASE TO PRAISE YOU.  

01:47:18.050 --> 01:47:23.170
 WITH YOU, ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE.  

01:47:23.200 --> 01:47:27.110
 LIKE AN EAGLE I CAN SOAR.  

01:47:27.140 --> 01:47:31.070
 WITH YOU THE GIANTS FALL.  

01:47:31.100 --> 01:47:34.210
 THEY RISE NO MORE.  

01:47:34.240 --> 01:47:42.030
 WITH YOU, I OVERCOME WHEN FEAR AND FAITH COLLIDE.  

01:47:42.060 --> 01:47:48.120
 THERE'S NOTHING I CAN'T DO.  

01:47:48.150 --> 01:47:54.120
 ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE WITH YOU.  

01:48:00.040 --> 01:48:07.290
 I AM CONSTANTLY AMAZED.  

01:48:08.020 --> 01:48:15.110
 YOU ARE A GOD FOREVER FAITHFUL.  

01:48:15.140 --> 01:48:23.010
 AS I LOOK BACK ON MY HISTORY OF PRAISE,  

01:48:23.040 --> 01:48:29.130
 HOW COULD I BE ANYTHING BY GRATEFUL?  

01:48:29.160 --> 01:48:34.190
 WITH YOU, ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE.  

01:48:34.220 --> 01:48:38.140

 ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE WITH YOU.  

01:49:11.130 --> 01:49:14.050
 NO MOUNTAIN IS TOO HIGH.  

01:49:14.080 --> 01:49:18.000
 THERE'S NO VALLEY THAT'S TOO DEEP.  

01:49:18.030 --> 01:49:21.250
 YOU'RE CALLING ME TO WALK BY FAITH  

01:49:21.280 --> 01:49:31.090
 SO I WILL STAND THE HEAT.  

01:49:41.020 --> 01:49:45.280
 WITH YOU, ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE.  

01:49:46.010 --> 01:49:49.180
