00:01:44.508 --> 00:01:48.502
- JP: Roger, Do you believe in heaven?
- ROGER: I guess.

3
00:01:48.506 --> 00:01:50.504
That's where they
say my mom went.

4
00:01:50.508 --> 00:01:54.503
- Maybe, that's where my dad went.
- Probably.

5
00:01:55.506 --> 00:02:00.500
(SIGHS) Maybe your mom
and my dad are friends up there.

6
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.503
- ROGER: That could be.
- JP: Cause your my best friend down here.

7
00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:06.505
You're my best friend too, JP.

8
00:02:22.507 --> 00:02:26.507
JP: Roger, how come Maggie's house
is called a foster home?

9
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:28.409
ROGER: I don't know.

10
00:02:28.504 --> 00:02:30.507
Maybe the first people
who let other people's kids...

11
00:02:30.508 --> 00:02:32.509
- ...live with them were named "Foster."
- JP: Oh.

12
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:34.508
So, If we stay there
a long time...

13
00:02:34.508 --> 00:02:37.500
...do we gotta change
our name to Foster?

14
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.508
- ROGER: No way.
- JP: Good.

15
00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:43.501
Besides, we're not gonna
be there a long time.

16
00:02:43.504 --> 00:02:46.507
- Really?
- Yeah, somethin' good's gonna happen.

17
00:02:47.507 --> 00:02:52.506
JP: Yeah, somethin' good.
Maybe today, even. It could happen.

trying to break a 14-game losing streak...

20
00:03:09.508 --> 00:03:12.505

21
00:03:12.505 --> 00:03:14.508
- (TIRE SCREECHES)
- Maggie, we're back!

22
00:03:18.507 --> 00:03:20.507
- So, where you been?
- Just riding around.

23
00:03:20.507 --> 00:03:22.507
You said be back by 5:00.

24
00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.504
I can't tell time yet.
Are we back by 5:00?

25
00:03:30.505 --> 00:03:34.501
Close. Come on, JP,
get your bike in.

26
00:03:34.501 --> 00:03:36.507
- Roger? You have a visitor.
- Yeah?

27
00:03:36.507 --> 00:03:39.509
- He's waiting inside for you.
- Is it?

28
00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:50.500
- ROGER: Dad?
- MAN: Hey.

29
00:03:50.501 --> 00:03:54.501
- Dad.
- Suprised to see me?

30
00:03:56.504 --> 00:03:57.506
Yeah.

31
00:03:58.509 --> 00:04:03.505
You look kinda scrawny. Don't
they feed you enough in this place?

32
00:04:05.503 --> 00:04:08.504
- Yeah.
- Where you been? I was waiting.

33
00:04:08.506 --> 00:04:11.504
Just ridin' around the stadium.

34
00:04:12.504 --> 00:04:15.501
- Angels still your team?
- Yeah.

35
00:04:15.505 --> 00:04:17.500
They're in last place.

36
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.504
- Yeah.
- Runs in the blood.

37
00:04:24.507 --> 00:04:26.500
Family that likes losers.

00:04:27.505 --> 00:04:29.500
(SIGHS)

39
00:04:31.508 --> 00:04:36.508
So, I came to say
that I'm goin' up north.

40
00:04:37.507 --> 00:04:40.507
I know I said when I came
it'd be to get you, but...

41
00:04:41.507 --> 00:04:44.503
(SIGHS) Things ain't workin' out that way.

42
00:04:51.505 --> 00:04:53.501
I did what I could with ya.

43
00:04:54.508 --> 00:04:56.508
Maybe if your mom was alive,
it'd be different.

44
00:04:57.508 --> 00:05:00.504
I, uh-- They had me sign
this thing, this paper...

45
00:05:00.504 --> 00:05:03.501
...some kind of release thing.

46
00:05:03.506 --> 00:05:05.508
Uh, just gotta go to
court to make it final.

47
00:05:08.505 --> 00:05:11.501
You understand
what I'm sayin', don't ya?

48
00:05:14.501 --> 00:05:16.505
- Y-yeah.
- Okay, I'm glad we got that outta the way.

49
00:05:26.502 --> 00:05:28.508
- Where's the pickup?
- Oh, I traded it in.

50
00:05:29.508 --> 00:05:32.500
The bike's better for travellin'.

51
00:05:32.504 --> 00:05:36.501
D-Dad, when we gonna be
a family again?

52
00:05:38.508 --> 00:05:40.503
From where I'm sittin'.

53
00:05:43.503 --> 00:05:45.505
I'd say when the Angels win the pennant.

54
00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.504
- DAD: You stay outta trouble, son.
- (ENGINE STARTS)

55
00:06:06.501 --> 00:06:08.509
MAN (ON PA):
Number 27., shortstop Steve Acker.

56
00:06:09.501 --> 00:06:10.507
RANCH WILDER (ON RADiO):
So with the Angels down by seven...

57
00:06:10.507 --> 00:06:13.501
...it's now one ball
two strikes to Acker...

58
00:06:13.501 --> 00:06:15.501
the fourth batter to face
Gates here in the eighth.

59
00:06:15.502 --> 00:06:18.508
- Come on. Strike him out!
- Yeah! Strike him out!

60
00:06:21.507 --> 00:06:23.503
Burn it in there.

61
00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:25.509
- Come on, Angels!
- Let's stay in this.

62
00:06:26.504 --> 00:06:28.504
RANCH:
Gates takes the sign...

63
00:06:28.506 --> 00:06:31.505
checks the runner at first
and delivers.

64
00:06:34.501 --> 00:06:36.503
Acker lofts the ball
high into left field.

65
00:06:36.503 --> 00:06:38.503
MAN: Gates, you stink!

66
00:06:39.503 --> 00:06:42.501
Norton and Williams
both going for the catch.

67
00:06:42.504 --> 00:06:45.503
- I-I got it. I got it.
- And this'll be Ben Williams's call.

68
00:06:45.509 --> 00:06:47.505
(BOTH GROAN)

69
00:06:47.508 --> 00:06:51.509
And Williams and Norton collide,
and the catch is blown!

70
00:06:51.509 --> 00:06:54.501
- (BEN PANTING)
- (NORTON GROANS)

71
00:06:55.507 --> 00:07:00.505
- Boy, they're bad!
- (ALL EXCLAMING) Ohh!

72
00:07:00.505 --> 00:07:02.506
And with another example
of his infamous temper...

73
00:07:02.507 --> 00:07:05.500
manager George Knox calls time out.

74
00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:08.500
He will have a word
with his pitcher, Frank Gates.

75
00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:10.502
I don't think it's
gonna be a happy word.

76
00:07:10.502 --> 00:07:13.501
RANCH (ON RADIO): And it looks like Knox
is going to take Gates out.

77
00:07:13.504 --> 00:07:16.500
Gates doesn't look
too pleased about this.

78
00:07:17.501 --> 00:07:19.501
- Gimme the ball.
- It ain't my fault.

79
00:07:19.501 --> 00:07:20.508
You need a new outfield.

80
00:07:20.508 --> 00:07:22.509
GEORGE: You're outta here!
Gimme the ball!

81
00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:26.501
You want the ball?
Here you go. Go get it!

82
00:07:26.501 --> 00:07:28.501
- RANCH: Gates has thrown his ball...
- And my glove? Go get it!

83
00:07:28.501 --> 00:07:30.502
- and glove into the stands.
- Go on! Get outta here!

84
00:07:30.505 --> 00:07:33.500
- GEORGE: You're finished, Gates!
- And Knox has attacked his own pitcher!

85
00:07:33.501 --> 00:07:34.501
BOTH: Uh-oh!

86
00:07:34.501 --> 00:07:36.501
MESSMER: Skip, Skip.
Let him go, Skip.

87
00:07:36.501 --> 00:07:40.509
- Get off me! You're crazy, Knox!
- You're washed up! You'll never pitch again!

88
00:07:40.509 --> 00:07:42.506
RANCH: They're clearing
the benches!

89
00:07:42.508 --> 00:07:46.502
- Now both teams are on the field!
- Hey! It's not our fight!

90
00:07:46.502 --> 00:07:49.503
RANCH: George Knox
has created total chaos!

91
00:07:49.503 --> 00:07:52.500
- GEORGE: Hit him one for me, Gates!
- I can't find him!

92
00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:54.501
- You're crazy!
- GATES: You can't manage a team!

93
00:07:54.501 --> 00:07:56.501
RANCH: This is outrageous!

94
00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:03.502
- George Knox fighting off his own players.
- (SIGHS) Surprise, surprise.

95
00:08:03.502 --> 00:08:05.504
RANCH: And they're trying to keep
Knox and Gates apart.

96
00:08:05.504 --> 00:08:08.503
- Come on! - I said, let me go!
- You stink, Knox!

97
00:08:08.503 --> 00:08:10.503
UMPIRE: Knox! You're outta here!

98
00:08:11.501 --> 00:08:13.502
Come on, Ump.
Leave him in!

99
00:08:13.502 --> 00:08:16.500
JP: Yeah! Don't throw him out!

100
00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:17.507
MAN: Hey! What are you kids
doin' up there?

101
00:08:17.508 --> 00:08:21.500
- (GASPS) Uh-oh!
- You better have tickets for that tree!

102
00:08:21.501 --> 00:08:23.500
Game's over for us, JP.
We gotta go!

103
00:08:23.501 --> 00:08:25.503
That's right, clear off!
Go on. Get outta here!

104
00:08:25.503 --> 00:08:28.509
You heard me! Don't let me catch
you twerps around here again!

105
00:08:28.509 --> 00:08:30.509
- GEORGE: You kickin' me out? That's good!
- Yes, I'm kicking you out!

106
00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:33.500
'Cause you been stinkin' up
the calls all day! - You're gone!

107
00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:36.504
GEORGE: You can't kick me out, 'cause I'm
leavin'. You get that? I'm outta here!

108
00:08:36.504 --> 00:08:41.502
RANCH: And Knox will watch
the rest of the game in the locker room.

109
00:08:41.508 --> 00:08:45.506
- (TURNS OFF)
- Murphy's out of his mind
to put up with this nonsense.

110
00:08:45.507 --> 00:08:49.503
- You think you can do any better?
- (SCOFFS) Blindfolded.

111
00:08:49.503 --> 00:08:52.502
Well, when you were managing, boy,
you had a lot of trouble. I remember--

112
00:08:52.502 --> 00:08:54.501
- (SIZZLES)
- Zip it, pal.

113
00:08:54.501 --> 00:08:57.508
You have to ask yourself what is
going on with this team and how long...

114
00:08:57.509 --> 00:09:01.501
will owner Hank Murphy put up with
this kind of behaviour from his manager.

115
00:09:01.501 --> 00:09:03.500
RANCH: I thought I'd seen it all,
ladies and gentlemen, but with...

116
00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:07.501
George Knox calling the shots,
you never know what will happen.

117
00:09:07.501 --> 00:09:09.501

Careful, JP. Let's go.

119
00:09:16.501 --> 00:09:18.502
Why do you idiots
do that after we've lost?

RAY: It's for good luck, man.

121
00:09:20.501 --> 00:09:23.501
DANNY: After fifteen straight losses,
I say we find somethin' else to rub.

122
00:09:23.501 --> 00:09:24.504
- Like Triscuit's head.
- Hey, don't even think about...

123
00:09:24.505 --> 00:09:26.501
- touchin' me anywhere.
- Fatty pants.

124
00:09:26.501 --> 00:09:28.504

should do this before we lose.

(ALL CHATTERING)

126
00:09:29.509 --> 00:09:32.502
TRISCUIT: Aw, not again! They got
the wrong kind of salami!

127
00:09:33.502 --> 00:09:35.502
Can't hit home runs
if Knox doesn't let you play.

128
00:09:35.502 --> 00:09:38.500
Hey, I can hit it. You gotta--
You gotta choke up and bear down.

129
00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:40.502
RAY: Then you'll get your own home run.

130
00:09:41.502 --> 00:09:44.503
- Hey, how's the arm?
- It's feelin' strong.

131
00:09:44.504 --> 00:09:46.504
You'll be pitchin' no-hitters
any day now.

132
00:09:46.504 --> 00:09:50.504
MAPEL:  We are the boys of summer
and it's a big bummer

133
00:09:50.504 --> 00:09:53.505
No matter who we play,
we give the game away

134
00:09:53.505 --> 00:09:57.501
'Cause we can't win,
That would be a sin

135
00:09:57.502 --> 00:09:59.502
We even lose the games before

- One more loss!

One more loss which
could have been a win!

140
00:10:20.508 --> 00:10:23.500
You call yourselves professionals!

141
00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:27.500
I have never, ever seen
a worse group of 25 players!

142
00:10:27.503 --> 00:10:30.506
You don't think as a team,
you don't play as a team...

143
00:10:30.506 --> 00:10:33.501
you don't even lose as a team!

so far up your butts...

145
00:10:36.503 --> 00:10:38.501
you can't even see
the light of day!

146

and I'll do this...Aah!

147

- to each and every one of you!
- Ho-ho-ho!

in uniform, at 9:00 tomorrow!

00:10:52.501 --> 00:10:54.503
We're going back to work
on fundamentals!

150
00:10:54.503 --> 00:10:59.501
-Fundamentals? In the middle of the season?
-I thought the game started at 1:00.

151
00:10:59.507 --> 00:11:04.501
It does started 1:00!
And you a jackass!

152
00:11:04.501 --> 00:11:06.500
- No, I'm a pitcher.
- (GEORGE GROANS)

153
00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:09.501
- You can be a pitcher and a jackass.
- Si.. Is very common.

00:11:09.501 --> 00:11:10.505
Ahh.

157
00:11:21.504 --> 00:11:23.500
I can't take it anymore.

158
00:11:23.503 --> 00:11:24.509
You have to start trade them.

159
00:11:24.509 --> 00:11:26.505
All of them, now!

160
00:11:26.505 --> 00:11:28.507
HANK: I can't trade 25 players.

161
00:11:28.508 --> 00:11:32.504
No, no, no! I can't win with
these guys. And nobody can.

162
00:11:32.505 --> 00:11:34.506
There's a thing called talent.

163
00:11:35.502 --> 00:11:38.504
- They don't have it.
- This isn't Cincinnati, George.

164
00:11:38.508 --> 00:11:41.506
No one expects you
to win big with these boys.

165
00:11:42.501 --> 00:11:46.506

a winning baseball team.

169
00:11:53.506 --> 00:11:54.506
We're waiting!

170
00:11:58.509 --> 00:11:59.505
What's that?

171
00:11:59.506 --> 00:12:02.501
David Montagne, administrative
assistant for media relations.

172
00:12:02.505 --> 00:12:05.504
You're scheduled to do Ranch
Wilder's postgame show here...

173
00:12:05.505 --> 00:12:07.507
- And he's been waiting.
- Oh, the press are all scum.

174
00:12:07.507 --> 00:12:08.508
They're meant to be kept waiting.

175
00:12:08.508 --> 00:12:10.506
- And Ranch Wilder's worse than scum.
- RANCH: Whose fault is that?

176
00:12:10.507 --> 00:12:11.508
That is not my fault.

177
00:12:12.503 --> 00:12:14.504
What ever happened to Barney or
Bailey, or whatever?

178
00:12:14.505 --> 00:12:16.504
You fired him, and they
hired me on Monday.

179
00:12:18.503 --> 00:12:20.505
Then I can't officially
fire you until Friday.

180
00:12:21.502 --> 00:12:22.500
Make a note.

181
00:12:23.507 --> 00:12:26.500
GEORGE: Oh, what a waste.
Uh, where, where, where?

182
00:12:26.501 --> 00:12:27.504
- Right here.
- All right, all right.

fine will be hefty.

We're on in 3, 2, 1.

187

RANCH: And we're back with
Angels manager George Knox.

188
00:12:39.509 --> 00:12:42.507
- This was a tough loss today.
- Any loss is hard.

189
00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:45.501
But this one really got to you.

190
00:12:45.502 --> 00:12:47.509
You leave Cincinnati after
ten years of winning ball clubs.

191
00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:50.505
although the really big one always
seemed to be just out of reach--

192
00:12:50.507 --> 00:12:52.505
and you come out here
to manage our Angels.

193
00:12:52.505 --> 00:12:55.503
Now, expectations were high that
you could turn this team around...

194
00:12:55.504 --> 00:12:57.503
but that just doesn't
seem to be happening.

195
00:12:58.509 --> 00:13:02.503
- Season's only half over, Ranch.
- And your club's in last place.

196
00:13:02.508 --> 00:13:05.509
You oughta know how one incident
can change the course of events.

197
00:13:05.509 --> 00:13:08.503
Well, you know, you play
the game, you take your chances.

198

Sometimes you're just in the
wrong place at the wrong time.

199
00:13:10.507 --> 00:13:13.505
- Yeah, you're an expert at that.
- I could say the same about you.

200
00:13:13.506 --> 00:13:15.506
- Well, actions speak louder than words.
- (CAMERA SWICHES)

201
00:13:16.501 --> 00:13:17.503
Well, that'll wrap things up
here-

202
00:13:17.504 --> 00:13:18.506
- Hey, I'm still on the air here.
- GEORGE: Oh, yeah?

George Knox. George?

205

the baseball game tomorrow.

and you have an interview.

the game anyway. Angels never win.

for dessert. Jell-O.

- Yea!
- It's not really Jell-O.

218
00:14:03.502 --> 00:14:04.509
It's cat brains
with food colouring.

and feeds 'em to us to save money.

00:14:15.505 --> 00:14:18.505
And you know I would never use
food colouring on my cat brains.

Okay, did we wash
our faces? Yeah?

225
00:14:31.502 --> 00:14:34.501

Been to the bathroom?

226
00:14:35.503 --> 00:14:38.501
Did you pick the lint from
between your toes? Yeah?

227
00:14:39.505 --> 00:14:42.504
- Did you say your prayers?
- BOTH: Yeah.

Oh, yeah? Night.

- JP: Good night, Maggie.

- I didn't wash my face.

peed the bed in a long time.

234

the bed last week.

235

And she makes us sleep in these
sleeping bags...

236
00:15:03.503 --> 00:15:05.506
'cause she too old to bend
over and tuck in sheets.

237
00:15:05.506 --> 00:15:08.501
She isn't too old.
She's got a lot to do.

238
00:15:08.504 --> 00:15:09.507
Did you guys pray?

239
00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:11.509
I pray every night you go to bed
without buggin' us...

Maybe tomorrow you'll meet
a nice family, Miguel.

250

help 'em win a little.

He's two and eleven.

number 22...

hardly any warm-up,

331
00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:12.531
Bass signals he's ready.

Just throw strikes!

RANCH: First pitch of the game.

339
00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:31.506
And the Angels have an
error and a man on base.

340
00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:35.809
So the fifth inning goes into the books
with the score nothing to nothing.

341
00:20:36.503 --> 00:20:39.507
The Angels thus far have been able to
keep the hard-hitting Blue Jays silent.

342
00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:41.503
But as we head into the sixth,

343
00:20:41.504 --> 00:20:43.505
The Jays have the middle
of the order coming up...

344
00:20:43.507 --> 00:20:46.509
with the ever-dangerous
Asher Lazzato leading off.

Please, just throw the ball.

RANCH: Here's the pitch.

351
00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:08.505
And Lazzato smashes
one to deep center!

352
00:21:08.505 --> 00:21:11.502
I don't think Williams
will get to this one!

354
00:21:37.505 --> 00:21:41.501

makes a miraculous catch!

Holy cow!

Yeah, holy cow!

What are you talking about, Roger?
What guys in sparkling pajamas?

370

You didn't see 'em?
Those guys carrying Williams?

- I don't know.
- Hey, mister, did you see that?

Lucky catch.

No, did you see what
happened with the clouds?

Did you see the people with
Williams when he caught the ball?

Two angels came out of the sky
and they picked up Ben Williams.

00:28:07.502 --> 00:28:11.501
And another angel hit Messmer's

00:30:31.504 --> 00:30:33.501
You know, that third one
tasted kinda funny.

497
00:30:35.502 --> 00:30:36.508
Chilli dogs.

498
00:30:37.503 --> 00:30:38.502
(KNOCKS ON DOOR)

499
00:30:42.504 --> 00:30:44.506
I'm looking for Roger Bowman.
Does he live here?

500
00:30:45.502 --> 00:30:46.501
Yeah.

501
00:30:46.501 --> 00:30:48.503
I'm George Knox from
the California Angels.

502
00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:51.505
Roger won a photograph
at last Friday's game.

503
00:30:52.501 --> 00:30:53.406
Oh!

504
00:30:53.505 --> 00:30:54.409
Uh-

505
00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:56.503
I'd really like to
give it to him myself.

506
00:31:09.506 --> 00:31:12.505
- Uh, you're Roger's mom?
- Nope.

507
00:31:13.503 --> 00:31:14.508
Aunt? Grandma?

508
00:31:16.502 --> 00:31:17.509
No, no.
We're not related.

509
00:31:18.507 --> 00:31:22.503
This is a short-term
foster care facility. I run it.

510
00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:27.503
- Roger is a ward of the state.
- Oh.

511
00:31:30.502 --> 00:31:34.501
Uh, s-so Roger, he--
he's got a wild imagination?

512
00:31:34.504 --> 00:31:37.502
- Always making up stories?
- No, actually.

513
00:31:37.509 --> 00:31:39.501
He's very grounded.

514
00:31:40.501 --> 00:31:42.507
Fact is, most kids who are
taken away from their parents

515
00:31:42.508 --> 00:31:44.501
by the court system.

516
00:31:44.505 --> 00:31:46.503
Have a good handle on reality.

517
00:31:47.504 --> 00:31:48.505
I bet.

518
00:31:50.503 --> 00:31:52.507
ROGER: Mel Clark strikes him out.
Cincinnati wins.

519
00:31:53.505 --> 00:31:56.509
MAGGIE: What do you want from him?
Why are you really here?

520
00:31:56.509 --> 00:31:58.508
Uh, young fans.
League needs more of em.

521
00:32:02.505 --> 00:32:03.502
Roger?

522
00:32:05.506 --> 00:32:07.503
- I got your pictures.
- Thanks.

523
00:32:08.501 --> 00:32:09.509
- Yeah.
- I didn't know you were bringing 'em.

524
00:32:11.509 --> 00:32:12.507
ROGER: Hmm.

525
00:32:13.508 --> 00:32:16.500
- Looks like a prison photo.
- ROGER: Yeah.

526
00:32:16.502 --> 00:32:19.500
Uh, you-- you said you thought
you saw something at the game.

527
00:32:19.503 --> 00:32:21.502
Yeah, angels. Real ones.

528
00:32:21.507 --> 00:32:23.504
Wh-- Why do you think
there would be...

529
00:32:24.504 --> 00:32:27.507
real angels at the ball game?

530
00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:29.504
Maybe 'cause I prayed for 'em?

531
00:32:30.501 --> 00:32:33.500
Nothing you were doing was helping.
I just figured it couldn't hurt.

532
00:32:33.502 --> 00:32:34.409
(CLEARS THROAT)

533
00:32:35.501 --> 00:32:36.508
Does he talk?

534
00:32:37.507 --> 00:32:40.506
Of course he talks.
He just doesn't like strangers.

535
00:32:40.508 --> 00:32:43.504
Uh, me either.
I don't even like my friends.

536
00:32:44.503 --> 00:32:48.503
Uh, these angels you thinkyou seen,
do you suppose they're coming back?

537
00:32:48.504 --> 00:32:51.502
- If they feel like it, I guess.
- Oh, this is crazy.

538
00:32:51.508 --> 00:32:52.509
I must be losing it.

539
00:32:53.502 --> 00:32:55.500
What I meant to say is...

540
00:32:55.502 --> 00:32:58.502
Uh, do you wanna come
to the game tomorrow?

541
00:32:58.507 --> 00:33:01.502
I have an open seat
next to the dugout, and you can...

542
00:33:01.507 --> 00:33:04.505
get your Aunt Maggie or
whoever she is to come along.

543
00:33:04.506 --> 00:33:06.504
- I don't go to baseball games.
- Oh!

544
00:33:06.508 --> 00:33:09.508
- But, uh, yeah, you can go, Roger.
- Can J.P. come too?

545
00:33:13.509 --> 00:33:14.509
Okay.

RANCH: After their
victory over the Jays...

547
00:33:19.506 --> 00:33:22.509
the Angels open a three-game series
against the visiting Athletics.

548
00:33:23.503 --> 00:33:25.507
Winning the last game may
have given these Angels a boost.

549
00:33:25.508 --> 00:33:29.502
Sizing up the team, I'd say
they look a little bouncier today,

550
00:33:29.502 --> 00:33:30.503
wouldn't you, Wally?

551
00:33:30.506 --> 00:33:33.501
(CLICK) Absolutely, Ranch.
As we saw in last game--

552
00:33:33.503 --> 00:33:35.505
RANCH: Keep it minimal, Wally.
They'll like you better.

00:33:37.507 --> 00:33:39.505
RANCH: We're 20 minutes
away from game time,

555
00:33:39.506 --> 00:33:41.505
and there are already
more people in the seats...

556
00:33:41.505 --> 00:33:44.501
than there were for
the last five games combined.

00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:59.501
Uh, yeah, peanuts, maybe,
and nachos, if you could.

What do I do? Mustard stains.
That's hot water.

so keep him happy.

- We gonna win today, kid?

don't tell anyone about us.

But nobody else.
We hate recognition.

We're a very sensitive group.

If people know we're around,
I wouldn't be able to get an angel...

Okay. Uh, are you guys
gonna help out today?

We'll see.
We never make commitments.

We're a capricious crowd.

Okay.

I gotta get back to the dugout.

What should I do
if I see another one?

611
00:36:46.503 --> 00:36:50.500
Kid, I was thinking of you
as a sort of good luck charm...

612
00:36:50.502 --> 00:36:52.508
not as someone
who spiritually hallucinates.

613
00:36:53.502 --> 00:36:54.502
What's that?

614
00:36:54.503 --> 00:36:58.505
It means if you see anything
weird, keep it to yourself.

615
00:36:58.509 --> 00:36:59.509
But wait! You should know.

616
00:36:59.509 --> 00:37:02.504

and the angels are here to help...

Calm down.

619
00:37:06.507 --> 00:37:08.509
In baseball, we got signals.

620
00:37:09.502 --> 00:37:10.507
Make some kind of signal.

every couple of seconds.

for most of the team.

665
00:39:45.505 --> 00:39:46.504
RANCH: So here in the ninth,

666
00:39:46.505 --> 00:39:48.506
the Athletics have opted
to bring in reliever...

667
00:39:48.507 --> 00:39:51.503
Tom Ruddy to pitch
to Angels heavy hitter

668
00:39:51.503 --> 00:39:52.506
Ray Mitchell.

669
00:40:05.501 --> 00:40:07.502
- Oh-ho, wow!
- What happened?

670
00:40:08.503 --> 00:40:10.504
There's an angel
right next to Hemmerling.

671
00:40:11.502 --> 00:40:12.508
Uh, David, I-I need a drink.

672
00:40:13.500 --> 00:40:14.506
- You have drinks.
- I don't want these.

673
00:40:14.507 --> 00:40:16.506
- I want something else.
- What else?

674
00:40:17.506 --> 00:40:19.507
Uh, coffee.

675
00:40:21.507 --> 00:40:22.509
You drink coffee?

676
00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:28.505
- Yeah. Of course. All the time.
- Yeah, all the time.

677
00:40:28.505 --> 00:40:30.505
What do you think we are,
little kids or something?

678
00:40:30.508 --> 00:40:33.502
Now, get me a cup or I'll scream.

679
00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:35.503
How do you take it?

680
00:40:38.503 --> 00:40:39.504
In cups.

681
00:40:46.502 --> 00:40:49.501
ROGER: Mr Knox! Mr Knox!
Come over here. We got one!

682
00:40:55.503 --> 00:40:56.501
Hey.

683
00:40:57.506 --> 00:40:58.509
What's goin' on?

684
00:40:59.503 --> 00:41:02.500
- There's an angel with Hemmerling.
- What?

685
00:41:02.503 --> 00:41:04.504
There's an angel massaging
Hemmerling's shoulders.

686
00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:15.500
(SIGHS)

687
00:41:15.508 --> 00:41:18.501
This is ridiculous. I don't know
what you see,

688
00:41:18.501 --> 00:41:19.506
but there's no one
with Hemmerling.

689
00:41:20.505 --> 00:41:22.500
ROGER: She's rubbin'
his shoulders.

690
00:41:24.505 --> 00:41:27.504
- Huh?
- A-A-And what should I do about it?

691
00:41:27.504 --> 00:41:28.509
Put him in.
Pinch-hit.

692
00:41:29.505 --> 00:41:32.501
I-I got Mitchell coming up.
He's my best hitter.

693
00:41:32.506 --> 00:41:34.508
Hemmerling can't hit
the broad side of a barn.

694
00:41:35.503 --> 00:41:39.500
I can't substitute my worst hitter
for my best hitter.

695
00:41:39.503 --> 00:41:41.501
If you want a hit,
you'll put in Hemmerling.

696
00:41:41.502 --> 00:41:42.508
It's crazy! Wacko.

697
00:41:43.509 --> 00:41:46.506
- You forget about it. Ah!
- But he's got an angel.

698
00:41:49.505 --> 00:41:51.504
Wait a minute. What's the worst thing
that could happen?

699
00:41:52.501 --> 00:41:54.506
Are we gonna fall
out of last place? Heh.

700
00:42:02.509 --> 00:42:06.500
Sit down, Mitchell.
You're up, Hemmerling.

701
00:42:06.503 --> 00:42:07.502
ALL: Huh?

702
00:42:09.505 --> 00:42:11.501
- What are you talkin' about?
- Yeah, what are you talking about?

703
00:42:11.502 --> 00:42:13.500
You heard what I said.
You're out and you're in.

704
00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:18.502
- You gotta be stupid!
- Hey, get your stuff!

705
00:42:19.502 --> 00:42:21.501
- Right.

Damn! Damn!

707
00:42:23.503 --> 00:42:25.506
As Mitchell was getting ready
to lead off,

708
00:42:25.507 --> 00:42:28.503
Knox has suddenly
decided to pinch-hit.

709
00:42:28.508 --> 00:42:33.504
And he's bringing in Danny Hemmerling,
the utility infielder...

710
00:42:33.504 --> 00:42:38.508
who is known, sports fans, for his
glove, but definitely not for his bat.

711
00:42:40.508 --> 00:42:42.507
Hemmerling for Mitchell?

712
00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:45.506
Go back to Cincinnati!

713
00:42:50.507 --> 00:42:53.504

I got the hippy-hippy shakes

for the first time this season,

and the Angels win the game.

Ladies and gentlemen,
this is unbelievable!

739

This is insanity! I've never
seen anything like this.

And, obviously, neither
have these umps.

Ladies and gentlemen, can we now say
the Angels are on a winning streak?

00:44:38.502 --> 00:44:41.506
Or were these last few games
just a small blip on the screen

747
00:44:41.507 --> 00:44:46.503
of a terminally ill patient?
Only time will tell.

748
00:44:46.504 --> 00:44:49.506
What is going on?
Where are my stats? I'm on the air!

749
00:44:49.507 --> 00:44:52.501
- My ass is hanging on the air...
- No, it's not!

750
00:44:52.501 --> 00:44:54.504
and there are no stats.
There were how many errors?

751
00:44:54.504 --> 00:44:57.505
- There were a lot of errors, Ranch.
- Not as many as in this booth.

752

Let me tell you, this is not baseball.
This is not baseball.

- Hey, David!

Whatever your duties were before,
forget 'em.

will be at all our games.

- Aw, whatever.

for us to talk on the phone.

00:49:26.503 --> 00:49:28.508
...coming up next week
with Cap Night...

832
00:49:28.508 --> 00:49:33.505
this year featuring a totally white cap
with red pinstripes and the Angel logo.

833
00:49:34.500 --> 00:49:37.507
It's free for the first 50, 000 fans
entering Anaheim Stadium.

834
00:49:47.507 --> 00:49:50.503
- I see an angel.
- Already?

835
00:49:52.502 --> 00:49:56.507
I gotta go bathroom. I can't go alone.
Bad guys might get me.

836
00:49:56.507 --> 00:49:59.502
We just came back
from the bathroom.

837
00:49:59.503 --> 00:50:01.504
- Gotta go now. Sorry.
- Gimme your Coke.

838
00:50:03.504 --> 00:50:05.501
Gimme the Cracker Jacks.
Stand up.

839

DAVID: Go.

840
00:50:16.500 --> 00:50:18.504
- What's-- What's up?
- We got an angel.

841
00:50:21.502 --> 00:50:22.509
But the game hasn't started.

842
00:50:23.506 --> 00:50:24.509
She was with Mel Clark.

843
00:50:36.505 --> 00:50:37.508
Aah! Impossible.

844
00:50:38.501 --> 00:50:41.500
She was there. That means Mel
should start the game today.

845
00:50:41.500 --> 00:50:43.509
- Mel's arm is gone.
- I don't care. He should start the game.

846
00:50:43.509 --> 00:50:46.509
Uh-uh. No way! And besides,
he's not even on the active roster.

847
00:50:47.500 --> 00:50:49.509
If the angel pitches with him,
he'll be awesome.

848
00:51:03.500 --> 00:51:04.509
You really do see something,
don't you?

849
00:51:07.502 --> 00:51:09.504
Yeah, I do.

850
00:51:27.500 --> 00:51:28.504
Good. All right.

851
00:51:46.506 --> 00:51:49.500
You're off injured reserve
and you're starting today.

852
00:51:51.503 --> 00:51:53.507
- You talkin' to me?
- Yeah.

853
00:51:54.508 --> 00:51:56.504
So get your stuff together.

854
00:52:02.504 --> 00:52:05.505
RANCH: Starting pitcher announced
for this game was Dan Prince...

855
00:52:05.506 --> 00:52:08.507
but just moments ago,
the Angels made a dramatic change...

856
00:52:08.508 --> 00:52:11.508
and activated the
long-injured Mel Clark.

857
00:52:12.500 --> 00:52:14.508
League rules specify that up
until the first pitch is thrown,

858
00:52:14.508 --> 00:52:16.502
the roster can be altered...

859
00:52:16.502 --> 00:52:20.501
although I can't ever remember
this happening so near game time.

860
00:52:20.504 --> 00:52:24.503
- Me neither, Ranch.
- Easy, Wally. Less is more.

861
00:52:26.504 --> 00:52:28.504
These warm-ups
should be interesting.

862
00:52:30.502 --> 00:52:32.500
Over the plate, Mel!

863
00:52:32.505 --> 00:52:34.504
- WALLY: Clark looks a little rusty.
- MEL: Unh!

864
00:52:35.505 --> 00:52:37.507
RANCH: Too much time
in the whirlpool, Wally.

865
00:52:40.505 --> 00:52:44.502
I'm checking to see if Dan Prince
pulled a muscle during his warm-up.

866
00:52:44.507 --> 00:52:48.508
There must be some logical explanation
as to why George Knox...

867
00:52:48.508 --> 00:52:50.507
would make such a bizarre change.

868
00:52:50.507 --> 00:52:53.507
I have personally checked
the stats, sports fans...

869
00:52:53.508 --> 00:52:57.501
and Mel Clark hasn't started a game...

870
00:52:57.505 --> 00:52:59.502
In this decade.

871
00:53:00.505 --> 00:53:02.505
WALLY: He looks mighty
nervous out there.

872
00:53:03.508 --> 00:53:06.501
RANCH: Not as nervous
as George Knox.

873
00:53:24.506 --> 00:53:26.500

874
00:53:31.503 --> 00:53:32.509

any more of those in him.

George Knox. George Knox.

906
00:55:00.502 --> 00:55:04.500
And we're down in the Angels' clubhouse
for a talk with manager George Knox.

907
00:55:04.500 --> 00:55:07.500
- What inspired you to start Mel?
- A feeling.

908
00:55:07.500 --> 00:55:09.504
An instinct. A kind of faith.

909
00:55:09.505 --> 00:55:12.503
A faith in what? Has Mel shown
this kind of power in practice?

910
00:55:13.500 --> 00:55:16.501
Mel Clark has always shown himself
to be an extraordinary athlete.

911
00:55:16.508 --> 00:55:19.504
The rest is about believing
in something or someone.

912

And when did you suddenly start
believing in Clark?

the bench all season.

01:12:17.501 --> 01:12:21.507
I'm sorry, George, but I'm relieving you
ofyour management responsibilities.

1167
01:12:22.504 --> 01:12:25.507
You can't do that.
We're only one game away.

1168
01:12:27.501 --> 01:12:31.506
I tell you what. I'll give you 24 hours
to get your head on straight.

1169
01:12:32.500 --> 01:12:34.500
Then I'll call a press conference.

1170
01:12:34.505 --> 01:12:37.507
And you can publicly
renounce this hogwash.

1171
01:12:38.504 --> 01:12:43.500
HANK: George, you repeat any of
the baloney I've heard here...

1172
01:12:43.503 --> 01:12:46.509
we're talkin' the end of
your career in baseball.

1173
01:12:47.507 --> 01:12:49.505
HANK: Have I made myself clear?

1174
01:12:50.500 --> 01:12:51.506
Yes.

1175
01:13:26.500 --> 01:13:27.505
MAN: What's goin' on, Knox?

1176
01:13:32.506 --> 01:13:36.501
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
We're gonna make this short and sweet.

1177
01:13:36.501 --> 01:13:39.505
My manager, George Knox here,
has something he'd like to say to ya.

1178
01:13:39.508 --> 01:13:43.504
- George.
- I have a statement I'd like to read.

1179
01:13:45.500 --> 01:13:46.504
There have been reports...

1180
01:13:47.504 --> 01:13:50.509
that I've been using angels
to help the team win.

1181
01:13:55.501 --> 01:13:56.505
MAGGIE: Go on. Go in.

1182
01:13:59.508 --> 01:14:02.508
(ALL CLAMORING)

1183
01:14:12.507 --> 01:14:14.502
I was gonna read a statement...

1184
01:14:17.505 --> 01:14:19.506
but instead,
I'm gonna shoot from the hip.

1185
01:14:25.502 --> 01:14:27.504
You know, there are
a lot of times in sports...

1186
01:14:29.503 --> 01:14:34.500
when there's no logical explanation
why things happen.

1187
01:14:36.501 --> 01:14:38.505
GEORGE: Sometimes a
player gets hot and...

1188
01:14:38.509 --> 01:14:41.507
goes beyond their physical ability.

1189
01:14:42.508 --> 01:14:45.503
Is it just adrenaline?
I don't know.

1190
01:14:46.503 --> 01:14:48.505
But I do believe
there are times in life...

1191
01:14:49.504 --> 01:14:52.508
where something stronger, higher...

1192
01:14:53.502 --> 01:14:56.500
or maybe spiritual is with us.

1193
01:14:56.508 --> 01:15:00.502
GEORGE: I can't explain it, but something has
happened to my players this year...

1194
01:15:00.509 --> 01:15:04.506
something that's changed
the way they play...

1195
01:15:06.502 --> 01:15:07.508
and the way I manage.

1196
01:15:08.504 --> 01:15:12.500
You can call it faith.
You can call it angels.

1197
01:15:12.505 --> 01:15:14.503
You can call it whateveryou want.

1198
01:15:17.504 --> 01:15:18.507
That's all I have to say.

1199
01:15:19.504 --> 01:15:22.504
RANCH: George, does this mean
you really think...

1200
01:15:22.508 --> 01:15:26.502
that a kid sees angels
at your games?

1201
01:15:28.504 --> 01:15:30.503
(CLEARS THROAT)
Excuse me.

1202
01:15:31.500 --> 01:15:35.503
I'd, uh-- I'd like to say something
on behalf of George Knox.

1203
01:15:36.500 --> 01:15:38.504
Uh, what's your name?
What's your business here?

1204
01:15:38.509 --> 01:15:42.509
My name is Maggie Nelson.
I take care of foster kids.

1205
01:15:43.507 --> 01:15:47.507
MAGGIE: One of these boys is, uh,
the child who can see angels.

1206
01:15:48.509 --> 01:15:51.509
He could stand up right now
and tell you exactly what's happened...

1207
01:15:52.503 --> 01:15:54.502
and I know you'd just laugh at him.

1208
01:15:54.507 --> 01:15:59.504
But, when a professional football player
drops to one knee to thank God...

1209
01:15:59.505 --> 01:16:02.504
after making a touchdown,
nobody laughs at that.

1210
01:16:02.505 --> 01:16:05.506
Or when a pitcher crosses himself
before going to the mound?

1211
01:16:06.500 --> 01:16:07.505
Nobody laughs at that either.

1212
01:16:07.507 --> 01:16:10.504
Seems like you're saying
it's okay to believe in God...

1213
01:16:10.505 --> 01:16:12.501
but it's not okay
to believe in angels.

1214
01:16:13.501 --> 01:16:15.501
Uh, I thought they were
on the same team.

1215
01:16:15.503 --> 01:16:19.504
Is it your belief, ma'am,
that, uh, angels play baseball?

1216
01:16:19.507 --> 01:16:21.508
Since the All-Star break, yes.

We all need somebody
to watch out for us.

01:16:30.504 --> 01:16:32.507
Every kid I have
ever taken care of...

1220
01:16:33.501 --> 01:16:36.501
has been looking for
someone to love-- an angel.

1221
01:16:37.502 --> 01:16:38.506
You gotta have faith.

1222
01:16:39.504 --> 01:16:43.507
MAGGIE: You gotta believe.
You gotta look inside yourself.

1223
01:16:44.509 --> 01:16:47.504
The footprints
of an angel are love.

1224
01:16:48.500 --> 01:16:51.506
And where there is love,
miraculous things can happen.

1225
01:16:52.503 --> 01:16:53.508
I've seen it.

1226
01:16:56.500 --> 01:16:57.507
I'd also like
to say something.

1227
01:16:58.508 --> 01:17:02.500
MEL: I don't know if there
are angels out there...

1228

other than the 25 of us
in uniform...

1229
01:17:05.509 --> 01:17:08.505
but I know there is
one thing I won't do.

1230
01:17:09.504 --> 01:17:13.505
I won't play for anyone
but George Knox. I believe in him.

1231
01:17:18.507 --> 01:17:20.500
That goes for me too.

left in sports heaven...

Tonight, George Knox will send
his Angels, real or imagined...

out against
a tough White Sox team...

to determine who will be
the Western Division champion.

GEORGE: When I came here this season,
I didn't believe in you guys.

1247

I didn't believe in anything.
But when you stood up this morning...

1248
01:18:38.500 --> 01:18:40.502
you gave me back
my reason to believe.

1249

I'm more proud of bein' a part of
this team than any team I've been on.
