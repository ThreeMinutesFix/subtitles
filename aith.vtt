00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.227
(projector whirring)

2
00:03:23.837 --> 00:03:26.674
(projector whirring)

3
00:04:25.533 --> 00:04:27.801
John Paul?
It's me.

4
00:04:30.838 --> 00:04:33.807
(alarm tweets)
Sweetie, I didn't know
you were coming over.

5
00:04:33.841 --> 00:04:36.009
Well, I thought
I'd make dinner
for us tonight.

6
00:04:36.043 --> 00:04:38.446
Oh.

7
00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:40.614
Did your mom
throw away anything?

8
00:04:40.648 --> 00:04:42.950
Uh... no.

9
00:04:42.983 --> 00:04:45.052
Uh, wait,
did you say dinner?

10
00:04:45.085 --> 00:04:47.521
Yeah.

11
00:04:47.555 --> 00:04:51.825
Because you cooked dinner
for us two nights ago.
I was just gonna order a pizza.

12
00:04:51.859 --> 00:04:54.928
I know, my lasagna
was a disaster,
but I'm redeeming myself.

13
00:04:54.962 --> 00:04:59.066
By the time we're married
next month and I move in here,
I'll have perfected 10 meals.

14
00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:02.670
And tonight I'm cooking
a perfect turkey.
Oh, the perfect turkey.

15
00:05:02.703 --> 00:05:04.705
But what about
the perfect pizza,

16
00:05:04.738 --> 00:05:06.874
made perfectly for you,
delivered right to your door?

17
00:05:06.907 --> 00:05:10.043
John Paul, you cannot
eat out this much.
That's why you have me.

18
00:05:10.077 --> 00:05:11.779
Come on. I insist.

19
00:05:13.514 --> 00:05:15.749
(exhales)

20
00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:27.528
Hey.
What's in the box?

21
00:05:27.561 --> 00:05:29.096
I don't know.

22
00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:32.566
Still going
through Mom's old stuff.

23
00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.602
You know,
I'm thankful for the house,

24
00:05:34.635 --> 00:05:38.772
but a lot of this stuff
just screams yard sale.

25
00:05:38.806 --> 00:05:41.875
This box said "Keep" on it,
so I figured I'd check it out.

26
00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:44.978
Anything else
out in the car?

27
00:05:45.012 --> 00:05:48.115
No, no.
No, go through the box.
I'm gonna cook dinner.

28
00:05:48.148 --> 00:05:53.721
Oh. Hey, you know
what's really good
is asparagus pizza.

29
00:05:53.754 --> 00:05:55.589
No pizza.

30
00:05:56.557 --> 00:05:59.860
No. Stop. Out.
Pi-- No pizza. Go!

31
00:05:59.893 --> 00:06:01.862
(laughs)

32
00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.956
So, what's inside?

33
00:06:28.989 --> 00:06:30.824
Look at this.

34
00:06:30.858 --> 00:06:32.826
What is it?

35
00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:35.128
It's my dad's
military stuff.

36
00:06:35.162 --> 00:06:36.864
Dog tags.

37
00:06:36.897 --> 00:06:38.632
There's a letter.

38
00:06:38.666 --> 00:06:39.933
(chuckles)
Look at this photo.

39
00:06:39.967 --> 00:06:42.035
This is my dad.

40
00:06:42.069 --> 00:06:44.972
Oh. So handsome.

41
00:06:45.005 --> 00:06:48.976
Hmm. You know, my mom
never talked about him
before she died.

42
00:06:50.944 --> 00:06:53.581
I always wondered
what really happened though.

43
00:06:53.614 --> 00:06:55.916
That must have been
painful for her.

44
00:06:55.949 --> 00:06:57.685
Yeah.

45
00:06:58.586 --> 00:06:59.853
Look at them.
They're so young.

46
00:06:59.887 --> 00:07:02.723
They had their whole lives
in front of 'em.

47
00:07:02.756 --> 00:07:03.991
And then he's gone.

48
00:07:07.795 --> 00:07:11.565
You know, I have no idea
how my dad died.

49
00:07:11.599 --> 00:07:13.967
I don't really know
much about him.

50
00:07:17.104 --> 00:07:19.006
Who's Eddie Adams?

51
00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:21.008
I have no idea.

52
00:07:23.176 --> 00:07:25.879
Well, why don't you
try to contact him?

53
00:07:25.913 --> 00:07:27.981
Maybe he can
fill in some blanks.

54
00:07:28.015 --> 00:07:31.819
You know I don't like
talking to strangers.

55
00:07:31.852 --> 00:07:33.987
You're supposed to
like strangers.

56
00:07:34.021 --> 00:07:35.656
You're a postman.

57
00:07:35.689 --> 00:07:37.958
But I don't like dogs.

58
00:07:41.128 --> 00:07:43.631
(beeping)

59
00:07:44.865 --> 00:07:48.068
Hi, I'm looking for
an Edward J. Adams, please.

60
00:07:48.101 --> 00:07:50.738
(stammers)
Edward James Adams.

61
00:07:51.739 --> 00:07:53.907
Oh. Wrong number. Sorry.

62
00:07:53.941 --> 00:07:57.077
Hi, my name
is John Paul George.
I'm looking for an Ed--

63
00:07:59.747 --> 00:08:03.016
Uh, y-yeah,
you can call back.
No problem.

64
00:08:04.051 --> 00:08:06.620
Hi, I'm looking for
an Eddie Adams, please.

65
00:08:06.654 --> 00:08:10.023
Oh. I-- I'm sorry.
My condolences. I'm sorry.

66
00:08:11.024 --> 00:08:13.193
Yeah, I'm looking
for an Edward Adams.

67
00:08:13.226 --> 00:08:16.129
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

68
00:08:16.163 --> 00:08:17.831
Next.

69
00:08:17.865 --> 00:08:19.933
I'm looking for
an Edward J. Adams, please.

70
00:08:19.967 --> 00:08:22.035
Uh, okay.

71
00:08:24.071 --> 00:08:26.039
Edward Jeffrey Adams?

72
00:08:26.073 --> 00:08:27.875
Well, I don't know him.

73
00:08:27.908 --> 00:08:30.644
Um, he would have
known my father.

74
00:08:30.678 --> 00:08:31.945
Really?
(beeps)

75
00:08:32.813 --> 00:08:35.082
Uh, is this Edward?

76
00:08:36.183 --> 00:08:38.151
How old are you?

77
00:08:38.185 --> 00:08:39.920
Twelve.

78
00:08:40.821 --> 00:08:42.656
Have a good day.
(beeps)

79
00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:45.292
(timer beeping)

80
00:08:45.325 --> 00:08:47.895
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no!

81
00:08:47.928 --> 00:08:49.663
What happened?

82
00:08:49.697 --> 00:08:51.131
Oh.
Ohh!

83
00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:55.035
I can't believe this.

84
00:08:55.068 --> 00:08:59.039
I know. I'm sorry, John.
I didn't know it would
burn that easily.

85
00:09:00.073 --> 00:09:01.775
What?

86
00:09:01.809 --> 00:09:04.177
No, I mean trying to find
this Edward Adams guy.

87
00:09:04.211 --> 00:09:06.113
I'm striking out
at every turn.

88
00:09:06.146 --> 00:09:07.781
Dinner was perfect.

89
00:09:08.982 --> 00:09:10.684
Perfect?

90
00:09:11.351 --> 00:09:13.821
Honey, nobody can
order a pizza like you.

91
00:09:14.822 --> 00:09:16.824
Stop it.
(chuckling)

92
00:09:16.857 --> 00:09:19.159
How many names
do you have left
on that list?

93
00:09:19.192 --> 00:09:23.096
One, and I'm expecting
to hit a brick wall,
but let's give it a shot.

94
00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:25.699
(beeping)

95
00:09:27.267 --> 00:09:30.337
(line ringing)

96
00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:33.340
(line clicks)
Hello?
Anyone there?

97
00:09:33.373 --> 00:09:35.208
MAN:
State your business.

98
00:09:35.242 --> 00:09:37.010
My name is
John Paul George.

99
00:09:37.044 --> 00:09:40.047
Like the Beatles?
Yeah, like the Beatles.

100
00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:42.816
The Beatles broke up.
(line clicks, dial tone)

101
00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:45.886
What?
What did he say?

102
00:09:45.919 --> 00:09:48.756
"The Beatles broke up."
Here, let me try.

103
00:09:48.789 --> 00:09:50.357
(line ringing, clicks)

104
00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:54.094
Hi, we're looking
for a Mr. Edward Adams.
He's a friend of my--

105
00:09:54.127 --> 00:09:56.864
Friend?
Wrong number,
Miss Manners.

106
00:09:56.897 --> 00:09:58.966
Are you always
this rude?

107
00:09:58.999 --> 00:10:00.768
(stammers)

108
00:10:00.801 --> 00:10:03.771
Do you know a Stephen George
that was in Vietnam?

109
00:10:03.804 --> 00:10:06.006
That's a name
I haven't heard
in a long time.

110
00:10:06.039 --> 00:10:08.876
Who's asking?
Stephen George's son.

111
00:10:08.909 --> 00:10:11.111
Good-bye.
(line clicks,
dial tone)

112
00:10:11.144 --> 00:10:12.946
(beeps)

113
00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:15.148
That man knew my father.

114
00:10:15.182 --> 00:10:16.884
That man
knew my father.

115
00:10:31.164 --> 00:10:35.035
He says 25,000 troops
will be withdrawn
by September.

116
00:10:35.068 --> 00:10:37.104
Do you believe a word
that guy says?

117
00:10:40.073 --> 00:10:43.777
Hey, preacher boy.
What, are we at church?

118
00:10:43.811 --> 00:10:46.914
(chuckles)
Always with that Bible.

119
00:10:47.447 --> 00:10:49.883
Just finding some comfort

120
00:10:49.917 --> 00:10:52.085
in a place that's
not really comfortable.

121
00:10:52.119 --> 00:10:54.254
What are you,
scared out here?

122
00:10:54.287 --> 00:10:57.057
(scoffs)
Yeah, I'm scared.

123
00:10:58.859 --> 00:11:01.428
And you know what?
This makes me feel better.

124
00:11:01.461 --> 00:11:03.196
Here, read this.

125
00:11:06.333 --> 00:11:08.068
4:13. It's underlined.

126
00:11:12.339 --> 00:11:14.942
All right,
listen up, boys.

127
00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:19.046
"I can do all things

128
00:11:19.079 --> 00:11:21.314
through Christ
which strengthens me."

129
00:11:21.348 --> 00:11:23.150
(soldiers laughing)
Amen! Amen!

130
00:11:23.183 --> 00:11:26.186
Hey, what are you,
a preacher boy?

131
00:11:26.219 --> 00:11:28.956
(soldiers laughing)

132
00:11:31.959 --> 00:11:33.927
You're going
to Mississippi?

133
00:11:33.961 --> 00:11:37.030
Just for
a couple of nights.
Just for the weekend.

134
00:11:37.064 --> 00:11:41.001
Okay, tomorrow, 10:00 AM,
meeting with two photographers.

135
00:11:41.034 --> 00:11:43.236
At 1:00
we finalize the catering,

136
00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:46.039
and at 6:00
we meet with the minister.

137
00:11:46.073 --> 00:11:48.341
How am I supposed to
explain that?

138
00:11:48.375 --> 00:11:50.243
Is it cold in Mississippi?

139
00:11:50.277 --> 00:11:51.945
John Paul.

140
00:12:00.387 --> 00:12:03.490
- Fine.
- (chuckles)

141
00:12:03.523 --> 00:12:06.994
But I am painting this room
while you're gone.

142
00:12:08.061 --> 00:12:09.262
Okay.

143
00:12:11.398 --> 00:12:13.300
Ohh.

144
00:12:13.333 --> 00:12:16.269

through the day *

* For something bigger
than myself *

152
00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:53.206

00:13:05.285 --> 00:13:07.554
Hello?

(gunshot)

158
00:13:11.458 --> 00:13:14.094
What'd I say?

159
00:13:15.162 --> 00:13:16.296
My name
is John Paul George.

160
00:13:16.329 --> 00:13:20.233
I'm from California.
We spoke on the phone
the other day?

161
00:13:21.568 --> 00:13:23.303
Never heard of you.

162
00:13:23.336 --> 00:13:25.538
We spoke two days ago.

163
00:13:25.572 --> 00:13:28.441
Go away.

164
00:13:28.475 --> 00:13:30.343
No!

(gunshot)

166
00:13:32.179 --> 00:13:35.382

Look, you don't
have to shoot at me!

167
00:13:35.415 --> 00:13:36.984
I'm sorry.
What?

168
00:13:37.017 --> 00:13:40.087
I think you know something
about my father.

169
00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:43.156
I don't know anything
about your daddy.

170
00:13:45.125 --> 00:13:48.161
Look, I'm gonna sit here
and wait until we talk.

171
00:13:48.195 --> 00:13:52.399
Well, you can sit there
10 years for all I care.

172
00:13:52.432 --> 00:13:54.367
I'll just sit here and wait.

173
00:14:21.094 --> 00:14:22.529
Come on in.

174
00:14:22.562 --> 00:14:24.431
Supper's on.

00:14:35.542 --> 00:14:37.644
I'm Wayne.

00:14:37.677 --> 00:14:40.080
Eddie Adams' son.

177
00:14:41.348 --> 00:14:43.083
John Paul.

178
00:14:44.217 --> 00:14:46.019
I know who you are.

179
00:14:50.057 --> 00:14:52.159
Can I use your bathroom?

180
00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:55.028
Hey, where are you?

181
00:14:55.062 --> 00:14:57.097
Well, I found the guy.

182
00:14:57.130 --> 00:14:59.332
Only, it's his son,
Wayne, and--

183
00:14:59.366 --> 00:15:02.569
(sighs)
It looks like they lived in
this same old house forever.

184
00:15:02.602 --> 00:15:06.506
So you'll be home tomorrow?
'Cause I really want you
to meet the videographer.

185
00:15:06.539 --> 00:15:09.442
Ooh, I like.
What are these?
Mom, you like?

186
00:15:09.476 --> 00:15:12.679
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Honey, I'll be home,
but I don't--

187
00:15:12.712 --> 00:15:14.447
What?
I can't hear you.

188
00:15:14.481 --> 00:15:17.417
Look, I can't talk now.
I just, you know--

189
00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:20.553
Can you call me in an hour
when you get better reception?

190
00:15:20.587 --> 00:15:24.457
I'll have some flowers for you
to pick from then anyway.
Okay? I love you.

191
00:15:24.491 --> 00:15:26.426
(sighs)
Love you too.

192
00:15:26.459 --> 00:15:28.428
(beeps)

193
00:15:28.461 --> 00:15:30.130
(sighs)

194
00:15:32.465 --> 00:15:34.201
Looks good.

195
00:15:35.402 --> 00:15:37.304
Killed it myself.

196
00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:42.575
Do you mind
if I say grace?

197
00:15:50.217 --> 00:15:53.186
Father, we thank you
for this food

198
00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:56.189
and we ask that
you strengthen us
with it.

199
00:15:56.223 --> 00:16:00.427
And would you bless
our time together as we learn
more about our fathers.

200
00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:02.329
In Jesus' name, amen.

201
00:16:06.366 --> 00:16:09.602
Listen, we sort of got off
on a bad foot out there.

202
00:16:09.636 --> 00:16:14.207
And I wanted to tell you
why I called you
and came out here

203
00:16:14.241 --> 00:16:16.343
was to see your dad
about my dad,

204
00:16:16.376 --> 00:16:20.247
because my dad said
that he and your dad
were best friends.

205
00:16:21.381 --> 00:16:22.615
Whose dad?

206
00:16:22.649 --> 00:16:25.518
Your dad and my dad.

207
00:16:26.786 --> 00:16:29.422
Well, you're
a funny guy, Ringo.

208
00:16:30.523 --> 00:16:34.227
Why did you make me
wait out there all day?

209
00:16:34.261 --> 00:16:37.330
See how serious you were
about talking.

210
00:16:38.465 --> 00:16:42.535
And me flying out here
didn't prove anything to you?

211
00:16:43.536 --> 00:16:45.238
Flying's easy.

212
00:16:45.272 --> 00:16:47.607
Sitting in
the hot Mississippi sun
ain't.

213
00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:51.578
Wait here.

214
00:16:58.485 --> 00:17:00.153
(clears throat)

215
00:17:05.358 --> 00:17:08.528
I'm going to bed.
I gotta get up early.

216
00:17:09.496 --> 00:17:11.298
W-Wait a minute.

217
00:17:11.331 --> 00:17:14.334
I came out here
to talk about our fathers.

218
00:17:15.668 --> 00:17:17.570
We'll talk
in the morning.

219
00:17:22.709 --> 00:17:24.644
(machine gun fire)

220
00:17:26.346 --> 00:17:29.182
(soldiers shouting,
faint)

221
00:17:29.216 --> 00:17:31.451
Sounds like
someone made contact.

222
00:17:31.484 --> 00:17:33.286
How far away?

223
00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:36.423
Don't know. A few klicks.
I wouldn't worry about it.

224
00:17:41.328 --> 00:17:43.496
When, uh...
When we go out tonight,

225
00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:46.833
should I keep my eyes on you,
the jungle or the ground?

226
00:17:46.866 --> 00:17:49.602
You know, in case
of trip wires.

227
00:17:49.636 --> 00:17:51.504
All three, Stevie.

228
00:17:51.538 --> 00:17:54.541
Should I ever look back
or should I just
keep looking forward?

229
00:17:58.578 --> 00:17:59.812
Okay.

230
00:17:59.846 --> 00:18:03.216
(soldiers shouting
continues)

231
00:18:04.617 --> 00:18:06.319
What are you doing?

232
00:18:07.354 --> 00:18:09.222
You're packing
too much stuff.

233
00:18:09.256 --> 00:18:11.291
Just take absolutely
what's necessary.

234
00:18:11.324 --> 00:18:12.659
Remember to
keep yourself hydrated.

235
00:18:16.763 --> 00:18:18.498
You ready?

236
00:18:20.833 --> 00:18:22.502
As I'll ever be.

237
00:18:26.473 --> 00:18:29.476
Hey, everything okay?
That last phone call was kinda--

238
00:18:29.509 --> 00:18:32.512
Oh, yeah.
No, it's fine.
It's, uh... different.

239
00:18:32.545 --> 00:18:35.615
But, you know,
I think I'm gonna
stay the night, so--

240
00:18:35.648 --> 00:18:37.750
Oh, so you must be
getting along well.

241
00:18:37.784 --> 00:18:41.754
Well, actually, you know,
he's kinda creepy and weird.

242
00:18:41.788 --> 00:18:43.723
Like a haunted house
type of--

243
00:18:46.459 --> 00:18:48.361
You want some coffee?

244
00:18:48.395 --> 00:18:50.297
Helps me sleep.

245
00:18:58.338 --> 00:19:00.340
Um, honey,
Wayne's making coffee.

246
00:19:00.373 --> 00:19:02.542
I'll call you
in the morning.
(beeps)

247
00:19:05.712 --> 00:19:08.281
(loud clanking)

248
00:19:08.315 --> 00:19:11.351
(chain saw revving)
(groans)

249
00:19:12.452 --> 00:19:14.787
(revving continues)

250
00:19:17.424 --> 00:19:19.592
Get off the roof!

251
00:19:19.626 --> 00:19:21.294
What are you doing?

252
00:19:21.328 --> 00:19:22.929
I'm sawing off
the roof!

253
00:19:22.962 --> 00:19:25.732
I see that!
Why?

254
00:19:25.765 --> 00:19:28.801
You can't go
on a road trip without
a convertible, Ringo.

255
00:19:28.835 --> 00:19:30.503
What road trip?

256
00:19:30.537 --> 00:19:32.605
(revving quiets)
No need to be yelling.

257
00:19:32.639 --> 00:19:34.541
You'll wake my neighbors.
(chain saw stops)

258
00:19:36.643 --> 00:19:37.810
What road trip?

259
00:19:37.844 --> 00:19:39.479
Don't drop the roof.

260
00:19:41.581 --> 00:19:43.750
(grunting)

261
00:19:48.555 --> 00:19:50.423
Get your bag.
I'm already packed.

262
00:19:50.457 --> 00:19:51.791
Don't worry
about locking up.

263
00:19:51.824 --> 00:19:55.628
I'm not so worried
about locking up as I am
about why you're sawing--

264
00:19:55.662 --> 00:19:58.898
I'm not reading
my daddy's letters
in that house.

265
00:19:58.931 --> 00:20:00.633
Wait a minute.

266
00:20:00.667 --> 00:20:02.602
Wait a minute.

267
00:20:02.635 --> 00:20:03.903
What letters?

268
00:20:03.936 --> 00:20:05.572
Letters
about Vietnam

269
00:20:05.605 --> 00:20:07.807
which talk
about your daddy.

270
00:20:08.875 --> 00:20:11.444
Well, can I see 'em?

271
00:20:11.878 --> 00:20:13.713
They're $500 apiece.

272
00:20:13.746 --> 00:20:16.616
(car door slams)
What are you talking about?

273
00:20:16.649 --> 00:20:19.386
You wanna read 'em,
they're $500 apiece.

274
00:20:19.419 --> 00:20:20.853
And we're going to the wall.

275
00:20:20.887 --> 00:20:22.922
Wh-What wall?

276
00:20:22.955 --> 00:20:24.557
Vietnam Wall.

277
00:20:24.591 --> 00:20:25.925
In DC?
That's the one.

278
00:20:25.958 --> 00:20:27.960
No, no, no.
I am not going to the wall.

279
00:20:27.994 --> 00:20:31.498
I'm getting married
in three weeks.
I'm not going to the wall.

280
00:20:31.531 --> 00:20:33.866
Well, congratulations.
(engine starts)

281
00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:36.403
(thunder crashing)

282
00:20:37.404 --> 00:20:39.772
All right, gentlemen,
listen up.

283
00:20:39.806 --> 00:20:44.644
Last night at 2300,
one of our C-47s went down
behind enemy lines.

284
00:20:45.612 --> 00:20:47.714
There were no survivors.

285
00:20:47.747 --> 00:20:51.984
We got picked
for the mission to go in
and retrieve the bodies.

286
00:20:52.018 --> 00:20:56.923
They're located within
a square mile somewhere
in the Mekong Delta.

287
00:20:56.956 --> 00:21:01.861
It's not reachable by air,
so we're gonna have to
hump it all the way in.

288
00:21:01.894 --> 00:21:08.768
The hump alone is 72 hours,
so stay alert
and do what I say.

289
00:21:08.801 --> 00:21:12.505
And we will go in there and
find our boys before the enemy

290
00:21:12.539 --> 00:21:14.841
and bring them home.

291
00:21:16.543 --> 00:21:17.910
Any questions?

292
00:21:17.944 --> 00:21:19.646
No, Sarge.
No, Sarge.

293
00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:22.949
Adams, George, take us out.

294
00:21:22.982 --> 00:21:26.419
Saddle up!
Lock and load, boys!

295
00:21:32.959 --> 00:21:34.894
(engine revs)

296
00:21:34.927 --> 00:21:38.465
I can't believe
you're making me pay
to read these letters.

297
00:21:43.570 --> 00:21:45.805
All right,
I'll make you a deal.

298
00:21:45.838 --> 00:21:47.640
I'll let you read one.

299
00:21:47.674 --> 00:21:50.076
If you like it,
we move on.

300
00:21:50.109 --> 00:21:52.579
Deal stands.

301
00:22:00.987 --> 00:22:02.755
"Eleanor,

302
00:22:03.956 --> 00:22:07.827
I can't begin to tell you
how much I miss you and Wayne.

303
00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:10.963
It's only been a few weeks,
but it feels like an eternity.

304
00:22:10.997 --> 00:22:12.899
I can't wait to get home.

305
00:22:12.932 --> 00:22:16.469
I met a guy from California.
His name is Stephen George.

306
00:22:17.069 --> 00:22:19.706
He's kind of religious.

307
00:22:19.739 --> 00:22:22.775
He's gonna be
a preacher or something,
but he's a good guy."

308
00:22:25.645 --> 00:22:27.914
My dad was gonna
be a preacher.

309
00:22:27.947 --> 00:22:29.582
I didn't know that.

310
00:22:29.616 --> 00:22:32.719
That's why they're worth
500 bucks apiece.

311
00:22:35.722 --> 00:22:38.925
"His wife back home
just had a little boy.

312
00:22:38.958 --> 00:22:41.561
That's all he talks about.

313
00:22:41.594 --> 00:22:44.931
He's naming the boy
after the Beatles.
It makes me think of Wayne.

314
00:22:44.964 --> 00:22:48.501
I miss you. Eddie."

315
00:22:51.838 --> 00:22:53.573
Deal.

316
00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:04.751
Why do we have to go to
the wall? Why can't we
just read the letters here?

317
00:23:04.784 --> 00:23:08.721
I don't need to see my father's
name on a wall to find
the answers I'm looking for.

318
00:23:08.755 --> 00:23:12.792
'Cause the answers you're
looking for and the answers
I'm looking for are in DC,

319
00:23:12.825 --> 00:23:14.861
but they're not
names on a wall.

320
00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:43.990
Stephen!
We've gotta fall back!

321
00:23:46.626 --> 00:23:48.661
Stephen!

322
00:23:48.695 --> 00:23:51.664
Stephen!
We gotta fall back!

323
00:23:51.698 --> 00:23:53.866
I've got you covered.
Go!

324
00:24:03.910 --> 00:24:05.978
Honey, it's
a two or three-day drive.

325
00:24:06.012 --> 00:24:09.215
I'll fly out of DC
or something.
I've already called work.

326
00:24:09.248 --> 00:24:11.884
Uh, no, honey.

327
00:24:11.918 --> 00:24:13.853
Of course
I haven't forgotten
about the wedding.

328
00:24:13.886 --> 00:24:16.656
This is just something
I need to do.

329
00:24:16.689 --> 00:24:18.591
(stammers)

330
00:24:19.158 --> 00:24:21.093
I don't care
about the flowers.

331
00:24:21.127 --> 00:24:22.862
You pick the flowers.

332
00:24:24.997 --> 00:24:26.833
White lilacs are fine.

333
00:24:26.866 --> 00:24:30.803
They're fine because
they're not traditional, uh--

334
00:24:30.837 --> 00:24:33.205
Yes, yes, you are
very traditional, honey,

335
00:24:33.239 --> 00:24:34.674
so in that--

336
00:24:34.707 --> 00:24:36.242
Hi, Cynthia?

337
00:24:36.275 --> 00:24:38.845
This is Wayne Adams.
How you doing?

338
00:24:38.878 --> 00:24:42.615
I understand how all this
must seem inopportune,

339
00:24:42.649 --> 00:24:48.120
but I want you to know that
I asked John to accompany me
to the Vietnam Wall for closure.

340
00:24:49.856 --> 00:24:52.925
It's been psychologically taxing
on us over the years,

341
00:24:52.959 --> 00:24:55.662
which is difficult
for anyone to comprehend.

342
00:24:55.695 --> 00:24:58.264
But let me tell you,
you are all he goes on about.

343
00:24:58.297 --> 00:25:02.001
He just went to the restroom,
so he's gonna
call you right back.

344
00:25:02.034 --> 00:25:03.269
(beeps)

345
00:25:03.302 --> 00:25:07.039
That's how you talk to 'em.
You tell 'em
what they wanna hear.

346
00:25:07.073 --> 00:25:08.808
It's 34 bucks.

347
00:25:12.879 --> 00:25:15.748
She's gonna think
I didn't wanna talk to her.

348
00:25:15.782 --> 00:25:18.751
Sounds to me like she was
doing all the talking.

349
00:25:18.785 --> 00:25:21.087
That's how she is, Wayne.
She likes to talk.

350
00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:24.023
She likes to control you.

351
00:25:24.056 --> 00:25:25.892
Wow.

352
00:25:25.925 --> 00:25:27.894
I'm traveling
with a psychologist.

353
00:25:33.833 --> 00:25:35.534
The 365's coming up.

354
00:25:35.568 --> 00:25:40.139
Take the next exit so we can
go straight through the state.
This is it. Get off right here.

355
00:25:40.172 --> 00:25:43.776
What are you-- Get off!
Take the exit! Get off!
What are you doing?

356
00:25:43.810 --> 00:25:45.311
What are you doing?

357
00:25:45.344 --> 00:25:47.914
Still can't drive
through 'Bama.

358
00:25:50.116 --> 00:25:52.118
Wayne.

359
00:25:52.151 --> 00:25:56.889
Wayne, this is ridiculous.
It's gonna take us
six extra hours to get there.

360
00:25:56.923 --> 00:25:59.191
You in a hurry?
Yeah.

361
00:25:59.225 --> 00:26:03.295
I kinda am, because
I gotta get back to California.
I got a wedding to plan.

362
00:26:03.329 --> 00:26:05.164
You're not planning a wedding.

363
00:26:05.197 --> 00:26:08.100
- Excuse me?
- Your girlfriend
is planning the wedding.

364
00:26:08.134 --> 00:26:11.237
You're just
nodding your head "yes"
to everything she says

365
00:26:11.270 --> 00:26:13.272
'cause you can't say no.

366
00:26:13.305 --> 00:26:14.707
You're afraid of her.

367
00:26:14.741 --> 00:26:19.211
Really? And you've
come to that conclusion
after knowing me for 12 hours,

368
00:26:19.245 --> 00:26:20.947
having never met her,

369
00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:23.750
and hearing one side
of one phone conversation?

370
00:26:23.783 --> 00:26:25.351
It's impressive, isn't it?

371
00:26:25.384 --> 00:26:28.120
- Why can't you
drive through Alabama?
- Oh, no, no, no.

372
00:26:28.154 --> 00:26:31.157
Don't change
the subject on me.
Oh, no, no, no.

373
00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:34.193
- Tell me you're not
afraid of her.
- I'm not afraid of her.

374
00:26:34.226 --> 00:26:37.830
It's just easier
to let her have her way
than to argue about it.

375
00:26:37.864 --> 00:26:41.367
- What's wrong with that?
- That's gonna be that way
your whole life.

376
00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:43.202
She's always
gonna tell you what to do.

377
00:26:43.235 --> 00:26:45.037
No, it's not.

378
00:26:45.071 --> 00:26:47.840
And she doesn't
tell me what to do.

379
00:26:47.874 --> 00:26:50.342
I just choose
to serve her needs.

380
00:26:50.376 --> 00:26:53.145
By being here right now?

381
00:26:53.179 --> 00:26:56.248
If I were you, I would
take her over my knee and--

382
00:26:56.282 --> 00:26:59.318
You know what, Wayne?
You're not me.
And you know what?

383
00:26:59.351 --> 00:27:01.253
And I would smack her!
I don't need--

384
00:27:01.287 --> 00:27:05.257
I don't need relationship advice
from someone--
Smack her! Aah! Aah!

385
00:27:05.291 --> 00:27:08.094
some backwoods hillbilly

386
00:27:08.127 --> 00:27:11.197
who's never probably even
been in a relationship.

387
00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:13.165
That's what I don't need.

388
00:27:14.867 --> 00:27:17.870
You don't know
anything about me.
You're right, Wayne, I don't.

389
00:27:17.904 --> 00:27:20.272
Why can't you
drive through Alabama?

390
00:27:20.306 --> 00:27:23.976
Don't worry about it.
Not worried.
Just curious.

391
00:27:24.010 --> 00:27:27.146
Why can't you drive
through Alabama, Wayne?

392
00:27:27.179 --> 00:27:30.116
Told you I'm not
gonna talk about it,
so quit asking me.

393
00:27:30.149 --> 00:27:32.284
Why can't you
drive through Alabama?

394
00:27:32.318 --> 00:27:34.186
Don't worry about it.

395
00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:36.989
Why can't you drive
through Alabama, Wayne?
Hey!

396
00:27:37.023 --> 00:27:39.792
I told you
to stop asking me!

397
00:27:39.826 --> 00:27:43.262
Get that through
your thick little skull
and quit asking me!

398
00:27:43.295 --> 00:27:45.932
You're like
a little woodpecker,
just pecking after me!

399
00:27:45.965 --> 00:27:47.934
Pecking! Pecking!

400
00:27:51.337 --> 00:27:54.306
Why can't you
drive through Alabama?

401
00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:57.109
(men chattering)

402
00:28:00.346 --> 00:28:02.181
You okay?

403
00:28:03.349 --> 00:28:05.084
Yeah.

404
00:28:09.188 --> 00:28:12.024
You know,
I got your back,
Stephen.

405
00:28:12.058 --> 00:28:14.193
Nothing is gonna
happen to you.

406
00:28:18.364 --> 00:28:20.099
You okay?

407
00:28:21.367 --> 00:28:25.204
I just wanna make things
right in my life.
I messed up a lot.

408
00:28:29.441 --> 00:28:31.944
You know,
I got a son too.

409
00:28:31.978 --> 00:28:34.213
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

410
00:28:34.246 --> 00:28:35.982
Just wanna get home.

411
00:28:39.318 --> 00:28:40.987
This mission?

412
00:28:43.422 --> 00:28:45.257
I don't know.

413
00:28:46.525 --> 00:28:48.327
I know.

414
00:28:50.096 --> 00:28:53.099
I wrote my just-in-case letter
before we left.

415
00:28:53.132 --> 00:28:55.301
I had one of
those feelings too.

416
00:28:58.971 --> 00:29:02.274
You're more than welcome
to read my Bible. It might
make you feel better.

417
00:29:06.278 --> 00:29:07.513
I don't know.

418
00:29:07.546 --> 00:29:10.416
SARGE:
We move in one hour.

419
00:29:10.449 --> 00:29:12.384
Hey, George.

420
00:29:12.418 --> 00:29:15.988
You ever consider
the possibility that
Private Adams over there

421
00:29:16.022 --> 00:29:17.990
is beyond the powers
of redemption?

422
00:29:18.024 --> 00:29:20.026
Thank you, Sarge.

423
00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:24.496
I don't think
that's something to be
joking about, sir.

424
00:29:24.530 --> 00:29:26.298
Now, why's that, soldier?

425
00:29:27.499 --> 00:29:30.536
Because that's a serious matter
between Eddie and God.

426
00:29:30.569 --> 00:29:33.940
You having
some kind of a funny feeling
over there, Eddie?

427
00:29:33.973 --> 00:29:35.107
No, Sarge.
You sure?

428
00:29:35.141 --> 00:29:38.144
Yes, Sarge.
George and I were
just talking about stuff.

429
00:29:39.578 --> 00:29:42.048
On your feet, George.

430
00:29:47.386 --> 00:29:50.389
You wouldn't be
preparing my men for death,
now would you, soldier?

431
00:29:50.422 --> 00:29:51.924
No, Sarge.
Absolutely not.

432
00:29:51.958 --> 00:29:56.028
'Cause I've been hearing you
talk to them about God
and the Bible and all that.

433
00:29:56.062 --> 00:29:59.198
You realize
that's not your job.
Yes, Sarge.

434
00:29:59.598 --> 00:30:02.201
As you were.
Sarge!

435
00:30:02.234 --> 00:30:04.203
Just came in.

436
00:30:06.338 --> 00:30:08.307
All right,
we got the location now.

437
00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:11.077
Two klicks north
from the fork
on the Giang River.

438
00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:12.544
Adams.
Thank you.

439
00:30:12.578 --> 00:30:15.114
That's right here, Sarge.

440
00:30:15.147 --> 00:30:17.483
- All right, let's go.
Take 'em out.
- All right.

441
00:30:17.516 --> 00:30:20.086
All right, guys,
grab your gear.

442
00:30:39.338 --> 00:30:42.108
You're not
a Jesus freak,
are you?

443
00:30:43.542 --> 00:30:45.477
What do you mean?

444
00:30:45.511 --> 00:30:48.380
A freaky Bible guy.

445
00:30:48.414 --> 00:30:52.351
Quoting scriptures all day long,
trying to convert people.

446
00:30:59.225 --> 00:31:01.260
So, do you believe in God?

447
00:31:03.062 --> 00:31:04.496
I knew it.

448
00:31:04.530 --> 00:31:06.265
Knew what?

449
00:31:06.298 --> 00:31:09.268
- I'm not gonna do this
with you.
- Do what?

450
00:31:09.301 --> 00:31:12.338
Play these games.
What-- What games?

451
00:31:12.371 --> 00:31:17.243
These beat-around-the-bush games
asking me questions about God,

452
00:31:17.276 --> 00:31:20.246
so you can eventually
Bible-bash me to death

453
00:31:20.279 --> 00:31:23.415
and tell me
I'm a terrible person
and I'm going to hell,

454
00:31:23.449 --> 00:31:26.318
all so you can feel like
you done your saintly duty

455
00:31:26.352 --> 00:31:28.454
by destroying
one of Satan's minions,

456
00:31:28.487 --> 00:31:32.158
all so you can secure yourself
a nice little place in heaven.

457
00:31:33.159 --> 00:31:35.427
Did you memorize that?

458
00:31:54.213 --> 00:31:56.648
Look, honey,
it's gonna take
a little bit longer

459
00:31:56.682 --> 00:31:59.151
'cause we can't drive
through Alabama.

460
00:31:59.185 --> 00:32:00.652
Why can't you
drive through Alabama?

461
00:32:00.686 --> 00:32:02.354
I-- I don't know.

462
00:32:02.388 --> 00:32:05.157
Um, I'll be home Tuesday
at the latest.

463
00:32:05.191 --> 00:32:06.658
John Paul,
this is not acceptable.

464
00:32:06.692 --> 00:32:10.696
- Hi, Cynthia!
- I gotta go
before he breaks his leash.

465
00:32:10.729 --> 00:32:15.301
- What have you gotten into?
- I can't talk now, honey.
Seriously, I need to go.

466
00:32:15.334 --> 00:32:18.137
- No, wait--
- I'll call you later.
I love you. Bye.

467
00:32:18.170 --> 00:32:20.572
I love you! Bye!

468
00:32:20.606 --> 00:32:22.541
(laughing)
Whoo!

469
00:32:24.610 --> 00:32:27.279
Forty-two bucks.
She was thirsty.

470
00:32:27.313 --> 00:32:30.516
U-Uh, s-so
you got this one.

471
00:32:31.450 --> 00:32:33.452
Uh, what do you mean?

472
00:32:33.485 --> 00:32:36.188
Well, chronologically,
I got the last tank,

473
00:32:36.222 --> 00:32:38.390
so that would mean
that you have this one.

474
00:32:38.424 --> 00:32:39.591
Chronologically.

475
00:32:39.625 --> 00:32:43.162
Chronologically,
you're about to
owe me $500.

476
00:32:43.195 --> 00:32:45.231
(men shouting,
laughing)

477
00:32:48.634 --> 00:32:51.437
(laughs)
Little girls.

478
00:32:53.239 --> 00:32:54.606
What are you
looking at?

479
00:32:56.242 --> 00:32:59.178
Big dumb hillbilly
with very little hygiene.

480
00:33:00.446 --> 00:33:05.351
Looks like
that feminine ride of yours
ain't got no hygiene.

481
00:33:08.787 --> 00:33:12.291
Hey, Jethro,
this ain't no trash can.

482
00:33:12.324 --> 00:33:14.326
You wanna take that out?

483
00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:16.395
Why don't you make me?

484
00:33:19.565 --> 00:33:21.467
Okay.

485
00:33:22.168 --> 00:33:23.269
Evening, sir.

486
00:33:23.302 --> 00:33:26.338
Could I interest you in
a couple of bags of beef jerky?

487
00:33:26.372 --> 00:33:28.607
This stuff is so good,
you'll punch your mama.

488
00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:31.377
- That's okay.
- What about some iced tea
for the road?

489
00:33:34.713 --> 00:33:37.649
Three dollars change.
You sure you don't
wanna buy any of this?

490
00:33:37.683 --> 00:33:41.653
(grunting)
Uh-oh. Somebody just
got punched in the face.

491
00:33:41.687 --> 00:33:43.522
Uh-oh.
Good grief.

492
00:33:49.595 --> 00:33:52.231
(shouting)

493
00:33:55.234 --> 00:33:57.269
Yeah, it's me
down at the gas station.

494
00:33:57.303 --> 00:34:01.573
Look, hey, send me
three or four deputies.
I got a brawl going again.

495
00:34:07.213 --> 00:34:11.417
Hey, look, you might
wanna roll the ambulance
with them, okay,

496
00:34:11.450 --> 00:34:14.420
'cause these boys are serious
and somebody's gonna get hurt.

497
00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:25.297
Ooh! I mean, he's putting
a whupping on this boy
like you ain't seen lately.

498
00:34:25.664 --> 00:34:28.334
(shouting, grunting)

499
00:34:30.636 --> 00:34:32.704
Uh-oh, you're not
gonna believe this.

500
00:34:32.738 --> 00:34:37.576
The yuppie
just took down Goliath
with an oil can to the head.

501
00:34:37.609 --> 00:34:40.546
Ringo, we gotta go!
Cops are coming!

502
00:34:42.348 --> 00:34:44.750
(sirens wailing)

503
00:34:44.783 --> 00:34:48.220
Why were we
fighting those guys?

504
00:34:48.254 --> 00:34:50.222
'Cause they was
rude to me, man.

505
00:34:50.256 --> 00:34:52.458
Nobody talks to me
like that. Nobody!

506
00:34:56.462 --> 00:34:59.431
Oh, what? What?
You got a problem
with that now?

507
00:34:59.465 --> 00:35:02.601
Uh, yeah, I do.
I just-- I can't believe--

508
00:35:02.634 --> 00:35:06.238
That's just the way things
are around here, city boy.

509
00:35:10.442 --> 00:35:12.278
You owe me a letter.

510
00:35:13.679 --> 00:35:15.814
A letter?

511
00:35:15.847 --> 00:35:17.483
All right.

512
00:35:27.759 --> 00:35:29.695
You know, I--

513
00:35:29.728 --> 00:35:31.563
I can't.

514
00:35:31.597 --> 00:35:32.898
I can't.

515
00:35:32.931 --> 00:35:35.701
I feel like you're
taking advantage of me.

516
00:35:36.802 --> 00:35:38.537
Advantage?

517
00:35:40.406 --> 00:35:43.309
You show up at my house

518
00:35:43.342 --> 00:35:45.744
and you think
I'm taking advantage of you?

519
00:35:45.777 --> 00:35:47.379
I'm trying to help you!

520
00:35:47.413 --> 00:35:49.481
I just helped you.

521
00:35:49.515 --> 00:35:50.982
That's right, you did.

522
00:35:51.016 --> 00:35:55.387
You found some courage in
that weak little body of yours
and you went all in.

523
00:35:55.421 --> 00:35:58.524
Okay, I went all in
to try to stop it.

524
00:35:58.557 --> 00:36:00.792
Exactly.
You went all in, Ringo.

525
00:36:00.826 --> 00:36:02.761
I'm proud of you.

526
00:36:05.897 --> 00:36:09.401
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to get you
into the whole thing.

527
00:36:09.435 --> 00:36:12.304
I just--
You know, I didn't expect--

528
00:36:13.772 --> 00:36:15.741
Me?

529
00:36:16.708 --> 00:36:18.577
Yeah.

530
00:36:21.547 --> 00:36:23.949
Boys, it took y'all
long enough to get here.

531
00:36:23.982 --> 00:36:28.587
Hey, look, y'all,
one bunch of 'em went towards
the interstate, all right?

532
00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:31.557
The other bunch,
hey, they went toward
the old highway over here.

533
00:36:31.590 --> 00:36:34.360
A big country redneck
and then a yuppie.

534
00:36:34.393 --> 00:36:37.663
Big redneck
driving a pickup truck.
He's bigger than you are.

535
00:36:37.696 --> 00:36:40.666
Then the yuppie
was driving some rig--
I don't know what it was.

536
00:36:40.699 --> 00:36:43.702
Oh, did he ever put a whupping
on that big redneck.

537
00:36:43.735 --> 00:36:46.438
One of 'em went that way,
one of 'em went that way.

538
00:36:46.472 --> 00:36:48.707
May even be a tooth or two
out there.

539
00:36:48.740 --> 00:36:51.743
Look, you boys need to get you
some of this beef jerky.

540
00:36:51.777 --> 00:36:55.547
But when they first pulled up,
they went to war
with each other.

541
00:36:55.581 --> 00:36:58.650
I don't know who's who.
It took y'all too long
to get here.

542
00:36:58.684 --> 00:37:02.454
Look, you don't wanna
try to punch my mama,
'cause she's like homey.

543
00:37:02.488 --> 00:37:03.889
She don't play that.

544
00:37:03.922 --> 00:37:05.357
You'll be swallowing teeth.

545
00:37:05.391 --> 00:37:10.462
That's all I know.
They left when they heard y'all
pulling up with sirens.

546
00:37:10.496 --> 00:37:13.899
Yeah. Look. Hey,
that's my report
on the fight.

547
00:37:13.932 --> 00:37:15.867
Y'all boys
want some beef jerky?

548
00:37:25.911 --> 00:37:27.579
What's going on?

549
00:37:29.481 --> 00:37:32.451
What do you got, Adams?
Path just ended,
Sarge.

550
00:37:34.886 --> 00:37:36.422
Henderson?

551
00:37:36.455 --> 00:37:37.856
Right here, sir.

552
00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:43.662
Big Dragon,
this is Little Elf.

553
00:37:44.996 --> 00:37:47.399
Big Dragon, be advised,

554
00:37:47.433 --> 00:37:50.902
Little Elf
has followed designated route
to grid coordinates.

555
00:37:50.936 --> 00:37:53.705
Route ends. Please advise.

556
00:37:58.677 --> 00:38:01.613
Big Dragon,
be advised Little Elf
has rechecked map,

557
00:38:01.647 --> 00:38:03.649
and grid coordinates
are correct.

558
00:38:03.682 --> 00:38:05.817
How current
is your information?

559
00:38:10.021 --> 00:38:12.624
Could you recommend an alt--
(twig snaps)

560
00:38:31.076 --> 00:38:34.513
(gasping, panting)

561
00:39:41.046 --> 00:39:44.683
What are you doing?
Are you crazy?
Now I'm crazy now too?

562
00:39:44.716 --> 00:39:47.619
I don't know, Wayne.
They seemed to be
doing just fine.

563
00:39:47.653 --> 00:39:49.821
What's your problem?
I don't know.

564
00:39:49.855 --> 00:39:53.024
Maybe it's just a Ted Bundy
death-by-mutilation
sort of thing.

565
00:39:53.058 --> 00:39:56.628
Well, just wave
your holy book at them.
Oh, okay.

566
00:39:56.662 --> 00:39:57.929
Getting lucky
in Kentucky.

567
00:39:57.963 --> 00:39:59.831
- Where you headed?
- New York City, mate.

568
00:39:59.865 --> 00:40:02.167
DC, if you want it.
Fair dinkum,
we want it.

569
00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:03.869
Thanks, man.

570
00:40:06.672 --> 00:40:08.674
(engine starts)

571
00:40:14.079 --> 00:40:16.582
This car's gorgeous.

572
00:40:16.615 --> 00:40:19.785
What year
is this bird anyway?
'65.

573
00:40:19.818 --> 00:40:21.920
What's your name?
Ted.

574
00:40:23.021 --> 00:40:25.991
His name is Ted.
Is that a funny name,
mate?

575
00:40:26.024 --> 00:40:27.759
(Wayne laughs)

576
00:40:27.793 --> 00:40:30.662
Hey, pipe down, Cowboy Ted.
How 'bout you?

577
00:40:31.897 --> 00:40:32.998
Oh, I'm Annie.

578
00:40:36.802 --> 00:40:39.971
Look at that.
I'm John Paul George,
and this is--

579
00:40:40.005 --> 00:40:41.372
Ringo?
(laughs)

580
00:40:41.406 --> 00:40:45.677
Ted, be nice.
Yeah, Ted. It's not nice to
make fun of someone's name.

581
00:40:45.711 --> 00:40:47.045
He's sensitive.

582
00:40:47.078 --> 00:40:48.714
Sorry, mate.
That's okay.

583
00:40:52.050 --> 00:40:54.820
- I'll go check on the rooms.
- I'll go with you.

584
00:40:55.987 --> 00:40:57.589
Stay put.

585
00:41:02.728 --> 00:41:05.797
- Are you guys brothers?
- (clears throat) No.

586
00:41:05.831 --> 00:41:07.833
We're, uh, just friends.

587
00:41:07.866 --> 00:41:10.869
He treats you like
a kid brother, you know.

588
00:41:10.902 --> 00:41:12.738
Well... yeah.

589
00:41:17.809 --> 00:41:20.011
So, why are you guys
going to DC?

590
00:41:20.045 --> 00:41:23.849
- It's a long story.
- It's a long ride.

591
00:41:24.215 --> 00:41:25.884
That it is.

592
00:41:25.917 --> 00:41:29.120
Where you going?
Making sure
I get my own room.

593
00:41:29.154 --> 00:41:31.757
Tell him
I'm gonna sleep outside.

594
00:41:33.759 --> 00:41:35.994
Does he really think
he's a cowboy?

595
00:41:36.027 --> 00:41:38.163
Yes.

596
00:41:38.196 --> 00:41:42.067
(laughs)
How long you known him?

597
00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:44.636
One long month on the road.

598
00:41:44.670 --> 00:41:50.108
We're cousins, you know,
so I think he feels this
obligation to look after me.

599
00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:54.145
- I've known Wayne two days.
- Really?

600
00:41:54.179 --> 00:41:59.785
We're, uh, driving to DC
to see our fathers' name
on the Vietnam Wall.

601
00:42:00.318 --> 00:42:02.053
Wow.

602
00:42:08.259 --> 00:42:10.095
TED:
How many rooms, mate?

603
00:42:11.963 --> 00:42:15.667
Scoot over, Annie.
We're under the stars
tonight.

604
00:42:15.701 --> 00:42:16.902
Really?

605
00:42:16.935 --> 00:42:18.970
Yep.
They didn't have any rooms?

606
00:42:19.004 --> 00:42:22.774
Some stupid boy scout jamboree.
All booked up for the night.

607
00:42:22.808 --> 00:42:26.111
(sighs) Where--
Where are we gonna sleep?

608
00:42:31.717 --> 00:42:34.019
Well, at least
it's not raining, huh?

609
00:42:35.353 --> 00:42:37.188
I think
I have scoliosis.

610
00:42:37.222 --> 00:42:40.225
There's a rock lodged
between my third
and fourth vertebrae.

611
00:42:40.258 --> 00:42:42.327
Isn't this
backwards?

612
00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:46.798
Shouldn't the boy scouts
be sleeping outside, working
on their camping merit badges

613
00:42:46.832 --> 00:42:49.134
or weaving a basket
or something?

614
00:42:49.167 --> 00:42:53.004
Yeah, is there some, like,
ultra-comfortable, super-dry

615
00:42:53.038 --> 00:42:55.173
hotel room merit badge
that I'm missing?

616
00:42:55.206 --> 00:42:57.976
Look, everybody just stop
your complaining, okay?

617
00:42:58.009 --> 00:43:01.146
It's good for you
to sleep outside.
Gets you closer to nature.

618
00:43:02.748 --> 00:43:04.215
I like it out here,
Wayne.

619
00:43:04.249 --> 00:43:06.985
And I like you.

620
00:43:08.253 --> 00:43:11.923
So, tell us more
about why you guys
are going to the wall.

621
00:43:14.392 --> 00:43:17.228
This guy
shows up on my doorstep,

622
00:43:18.196 --> 00:43:20.031
and here we are.

623
00:43:21.967 --> 00:43:24.235
John Paul told me
about the letters.

624
00:43:24.269 --> 00:43:25.671
Can I read one?

625
00:43:29.174 --> 00:43:33.178
You ever gonna read
that thing? You paid for it.
You might as well read it.

626
00:43:33.211 --> 00:43:34.880
Paid for it?

627
00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:37.182
Long story.

628
00:43:50.095 --> 00:43:51.396
"Dear Eleanor."

629
00:43:51.429 --> 00:43:54.065
Who's that?

630
00:43:54.099 --> 00:43:55.400
That's my mama.

631
00:43:55.433 --> 00:43:57.235
Where's she?

632
00:43:58.169 --> 00:43:59.905
Dead.

633
00:44:02.073 --> 00:44:03.775
Pretty name.

634
00:44:06.912 --> 00:44:12.183
"Dear Eleanor and Wayne,
It's been raining here
for 12 days straight."

635
00:44:12.217 --> 00:44:14.419
EDDIE'S VOICE:
Not much to say, I guess.

636
00:44:14.452 --> 00:44:17.789
Just wondering
how you all are doing.

637
00:44:17.823 --> 00:44:22.293
I've been looking at things
a little differently, thanks
to this guy, Stephen George.

638
00:44:22.327 --> 00:44:24.029
He's a good man.

639
00:44:24.062 --> 00:44:27.365
He doesn't judge me
and I can open up to him.

640
00:44:27.398 --> 00:44:28.666
He's small.

641
00:44:28.700 --> 00:44:33.204
He's not a great soldier,
but he's bigger
than any man out here.

642
00:44:34.405 --> 00:44:38.209
I've written eight times,
and I haven't heard from you.

643
00:44:38.243 --> 00:44:41.312
I'd like to know
how Wayne's doing
in preschool.

644
00:44:41.346 --> 00:44:44.082
Okay, I love you.

645
00:44:44.115 --> 00:44:45.416
Eddie.

646
00:44:45.450 --> 00:44:48.086
(thunder rumbling,
crashing)

647
00:45:06.171 --> 00:45:08.139
(grunts)

648
00:45:08.173 --> 00:45:09.875
Hey.

649
00:45:09.908 --> 00:45:11.877
Where is everyone?

650
00:45:15.213 --> 00:45:17.348
(laughs)

651
00:45:17.382 --> 00:45:19.317
Uh, you hungry?
I'm starving.

652
00:45:20.118 --> 00:45:21.152
Starving.

653
00:45:21.186 --> 00:45:21.887
(spits)

654
00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:23.989
Annie needs coffee.
That's good.

655
00:45:24.022 --> 00:45:25.991
Who's got
the coffee?

656
00:45:26.024 --> 00:45:27.392
Need
the coffee.

657
00:45:27.425 --> 00:45:31.863
Why don't I wake him up
and then the four of us
will go get something?

658
00:45:31.897 --> 00:45:34.099
- Yeah, sure, mate.
- Okay. Cool.

659
00:45:34.132 --> 00:45:36.001
Cool.

660
00:45:38.369 --> 00:45:40.405
(grunting)

661
00:45:40.438 --> 00:45:42.941
Wake up.
Wake up.

662
00:45:46.444 --> 00:45:49.915
Maybe I'll just
let them do it.

663
00:45:50.916 --> 00:45:53.284
You know, maybe
we oughta just wait.

664
00:45:53.318 --> 00:45:55.921
He's a little, uh--

665
00:45:55.954 --> 00:45:58.023
Well, mate,
I'm not waiting anymore.

666
00:45:58.056 --> 00:46:00.225
I saw a store
about a mile back
last night.

667
00:46:00.258 --> 00:46:03.394
- Come on, Annie, let's go.
- I can wait.

668
00:46:03.428 --> 00:46:06.031
Look, you guys,
it's just not--

669
00:46:06.064 --> 00:46:09.200
All right, look.
I'm sorry, okay?

670
00:46:09.234 --> 00:46:12.537
I just get all cranked out
when I don't get good sleep.
All right?

671
00:46:12.570 --> 00:46:16.474
So how about the three of us
go get some coffee and some
breakfast stuff with the car,

672
00:46:16.507 --> 00:46:19.077
come back and get Wayne
when he gets up?

673
00:46:19.110 --> 00:46:21.012
Yeah.

674
00:46:21.046 --> 00:46:23.014
I don't know, you guys.

675
00:46:23.048 --> 00:46:25.450
Well, then Annie
and I'll go get it.

676
00:46:25.483 --> 00:46:28.219
- I don't know.
- It'll be fine, mate.

677
00:46:28.253 --> 00:46:31.022
We'll just
take the car.
Uh--

678
00:46:31.056 --> 00:46:32.290
Yeah.
We'll be right back.

679
00:46:32.323 --> 00:46:34.425
With coffee.
TED:
She's a beauty.

680
00:46:34.459 --> 00:46:36.394
Not a scratch, mate.

681
00:46:39.064 --> 00:46:41.166
(engine starts)
It's not that big of a deal.

682
00:46:41.199 --> 00:46:44.302
I could just try
to wake him up
one more time.

683
00:46:49.274 --> 00:46:51.209
(grunting)

684
00:46:56.481 --> 00:46:58.349
Oh, boy.

685
00:47:15.166 --> 00:47:17.402
Ringo, where's my car?

686
00:47:26.111 --> 00:47:30.115
Tell me you didn't
let him take my car.

687
00:47:30.148 --> 00:47:32.450
They said
they'd be right back.

688
00:47:35.386 --> 00:47:38.089
How could you let him
take my car?

689
00:47:38.123 --> 00:47:40.591
- They said
they'd be right back.
- No, you moron!

690
00:47:40.625 --> 00:47:43.394
They stole my car!

691
00:47:43.428 --> 00:47:45.496
Don't call me names.

692
00:47:45.530 --> 00:47:48.166
Moron!

693
00:47:48.199 --> 00:47:50.535
Stop calling me that.
Moron!

694
00:47:50.568 --> 00:47:52.537
If you call me moron
one more time--

695
00:47:52.570 --> 00:47:54.572
What are you gonna do
about it, huh?

696
00:47:54.605 --> 00:47:56.507
(shouts)

697
00:48:43.454 --> 00:48:46.657
(chickens clucking)

698
00:48:46.691 --> 00:48:48.526
(goat bleating)

699
00:48:51.596 --> 00:48:53.398
Wait here.

700
00:48:53.431 --> 00:48:58.536
Oh, tell me
you're not considering
the services of this car.

701
00:48:58.569 --> 00:49:01.272
I'll take care of it.

702
00:49:01.306 --> 00:49:02.507
(scoffs)

703
00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:17.222
Nice move, Grace.

704
00:49:30.668 --> 00:49:33.104
Oh. Why, hello.

705
00:49:33.138 --> 00:49:35.540
What's your name?

706
00:49:41.779 --> 00:49:44.149
Um, look, we--

707
00:49:44.182 --> 00:49:45.616
Uh, that car
that's out there,

708
00:49:45.650 --> 00:49:48.653
the one with
the "for sale" sign,
I wanna buy it.

709
00:49:48.686 --> 00:49:51.322
$1,200 firm, cash only.

710
00:49:53.558 --> 00:49:55.293
(laughs)

711
00:49:56.427 --> 00:49:58.129
I have $600.

712
00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:05.236
Excellent handling.

713
00:50:08.173 --> 00:50:10.275
Little girl?

714
00:50:10.808 --> 00:50:14.179
Ah... we'll take it.

715
00:50:14.212 --> 00:50:15.613
He's got the money.

716
00:50:18.549 --> 00:50:20.251
You have $600?

717
00:50:20.285 --> 00:50:23.188
Well, you handled that
really well, didn't you?

718
00:50:23.221 --> 00:50:25.523
And I'm out $600.

719
00:50:25.556 --> 00:50:27.658
No, you're not.
You're only out
a hundred dollars.

720
00:50:27.692 --> 00:50:31.362
And you know what, Wayne?
I really don't care.

721
00:50:31.396 --> 00:50:34.265
Because I did the deal,
and the deal's done.

722
00:50:34.299 --> 00:50:37.268
So you could show
a little more gratitude.

723
00:50:37.302 --> 00:50:39.170
Hey, Ringo, guess what?

724
00:50:39.204 --> 00:50:40.805
I'm not showing
any gratitude

725
00:50:40.838 --> 00:50:45.343
'cause I'm driving
a 1984 VW Rabbit

726
00:50:45.376 --> 00:50:50.315
when I should be driving
my 1965 Ford Thunderbird!

727
00:51:01.326 --> 00:51:03.328
(engine revving)

728
00:51:03.361 --> 00:51:04.662
(tires screeching)

729
00:51:06.497 --> 00:51:09.434
- What are you doing?
- Let's see what this
little baby can do.

730
00:51:09.467 --> 00:51:12.203
- Slow down!
- (tires screeching)

731
00:51:16.474 --> 00:51:19.577
- (clears throat)
- I was wrong about this car.

732
00:51:19.610 --> 00:51:21.212
What?

733
00:51:24.349 --> 00:51:25.783
Truck!
Truck, truck, truck!
The truck!

734
00:51:25.816 --> 00:51:28.286
(screaming)

735
00:51:30.755 --> 00:51:32.623
Huh? Whoo!

736
00:51:32.657 --> 00:51:34.392
(panting)

737
00:51:36.327 --> 00:51:37.662
(siren wailing)

738
00:51:39.630 --> 00:51:41.332
No.
Where did he go?

739
00:51:41.366 --> 00:51:43.468
No, no, no, no!

740
00:51:46.371 --> 00:51:48.473
What are you--
Stop the car, Wayne!

741
00:51:58.783 --> 00:52:00.485
(siren stops)

742
00:52:02.787 --> 00:52:06.291
- Look, I have
a suspended license--
- What?

743
00:52:06.324 --> 00:52:09.394
a few warrants
and no ID.

744
00:52:10.795 --> 00:52:14.499
My name is Edward...

745
00:52:16.401 --> 00:52:18.769
(car door closes)
Brisko.

746
00:52:18.803 --> 00:52:21.872
- You got it?
- Driver, slowly step out
of the vehicle.

747
00:52:21.906 --> 00:52:23.841
Place your hands
on the hood.

748
00:52:23.874 --> 00:52:27.278
Passenger, put your hands
on the dash.

749
00:52:27.312 --> 00:52:30.515
Okay, Officer,
but this isn't my car.

750
00:52:37.388 --> 00:52:39.424
Don't move.
Okay.

751
00:52:40.758 --> 00:52:43.361
- This your car?
- Yes, sir.

752
00:52:43.394 --> 00:52:44.795
Step out of the vehicle,
please.

753
00:52:44.829 --> 00:52:47.432
Driver's license,
registration,
proof of insurance.

754
00:52:51.836 --> 00:52:56.674
Um, you see, we, uh,
were just test-driving it

755
00:52:56.707 --> 00:52:58.643
'cause we just bought it,
you know.

756
00:52:58.676 --> 00:53:01.646
No, we weren't test-driving it
because we did just buy it.

757
00:53:01.679 --> 00:53:04.349
And I don't have insurance
'cause I'm from California,
Officer.

758
00:53:04.382 --> 00:53:05.716
John Paul George?

759
00:53:06.917 --> 00:53:09.820
- Yes.
- Three first names?

760
00:53:09.854 --> 00:53:11.689
That's what I said too, sir.

761
00:53:12.757 --> 00:53:15.360
- Where's yours?
- Uh--

762
00:53:15.393 --> 00:53:16.827
Well, I don't have mine on me.

763
00:53:16.861 --> 00:53:20.631
See, I was just
driving the car up the hill
'cause he can't drive a stick.

764
00:53:20.665 --> 00:53:22.700
That makes two of you.
What's your name?

765
00:53:22.733 --> 00:53:24.735
Mine?

766
00:53:24.769 --> 00:53:26.737
Um...

767
00:53:26.771 --> 00:53:28.473
Eddie Brisko.

768
00:53:30.508 --> 00:53:33.844
- This your friend?
- Yes, sir.

769
00:53:33.878 --> 00:53:36.481
That his name?

770
00:53:41.752 --> 00:53:44.489
No, it's Wayne Adams.

771
00:53:46.691 --> 00:53:49.594
Put your hands
on top of your head.
Interlock your fingers.

772
00:54:13.518 --> 00:54:15.553
You got two minutes.

773
00:54:31.602 --> 00:54:33.504
Hey, Cynthia, it's me.

774
00:54:33.538 --> 00:54:35.806
I'm on my way home,
but I may need bail.

775
00:54:37.442 --> 00:54:39.043
Bail? For jail?

776
00:54:39.076 --> 00:54:42.046
Who are you right now?
Calm down.

777
00:54:42.079 --> 00:54:44.782
No, don't tell me
to calm down.

778
00:54:44.815 --> 00:54:46.617
Okay, I can't take this.

779
00:54:46.651 --> 00:54:49.420
I don't know where you are
or who you're with.

780
00:54:49.454 --> 00:54:51.922
Cynthia--
No, Jonathan,
I'm serious.

781
00:54:51.956 --> 00:54:53.791
If you don't
come home right now--

782
00:54:53.824 --> 00:54:57.495
I can't come home right now.
I'm in jail.

783
00:54:57.528 --> 00:55:00.531
(line clicks,
dial tone)
Cyn--

784
00:55:02.700 --> 00:55:04.469
(sighs)

785
00:55:05.670 --> 00:55:07.538
Women.

786
00:55:07.572 --> 00:55:09.640
This is why we need dads.

787
00:55:16.113 --> 00:55:18.082
So, you gonna make a call
or anything?

788
00:55:18.115 --> 00:55:22.520
'Cause I hear the guys
in "D" Block are planning
an escape at midnight.

789
00:55:24.555 --> 00:55:26.957
This funny to you, Ringo?

790
00:55:26.991 --> 00:55:28.993
Yeah, Wayne, it is.

791
00:55:29.026 --> 00:55:31.929
It's one big joke.

792
00:55:39.604 --> 00:55:40.905
So, what'd you do?

793
00:55:42.907 --> 00:55:46.977
'Bama ain't the only state
I can't drive through.

794
00:55:47.011 --> 00:55:48.879
Why?

795
00:55:50.581 --> 00:55:53.518
'Cause this ain't the first time
I made this trip.

796
00:56:02.693 --> 00:56:05.996
Came to the wall 16 years ago.

797
00:56:06.030 --> 00:56:08.766
My mama wanted to see it.

798
00:56:09.834 --> 00:56:11.936
We never made it.

799
00:56:12.903 --> 00:56:15.673
(boy crying)

800
00:56:15.706 --> 00:56:18.609
Mommy, no!
(siren wailing)

801
00:56:22.647 --> 00:56:24.949
Got hit by a drunk driver.

802
00:56:27.752 --> 00:56:30.655
Crashed our car
into the bridge.

803
00:56:42.967 --> 00:56:45.035
Mama died.

804
00:56:47.972 --> 00:56:49.940
So I was scared,

805
00:56:49.974 --> 00:56:51.942
and I just hid

806
00:56:54.779 --> 00:56:56.881
till the ambulance came

807
00:57:02.186 --> 00:57:04.589
and took her away.

808
00:57:12.029 --> 00:57:13.964
I just ran.

809
00:57:16.200 --> 00:57:18.736
Like a stupid kid, I ran.

810
00:57:21.706 --> 00:57:24.609
(sniffles)
I needed money to get home,

811
00:57:26.143 --> 00:57:28.646
so I robbed the first...

812
00:57:29.614 --> 00:57:31.782
gas station I saw.

813
00:57:35.119 --> 00:57:37.655
I didn't hurt anybody.

814
00:57:43.628 --> 00:57:45.863
So just relax, Ringo.

815
00:57:48.933 --> 00:57:51.736
You'll be out of here
in the morning.

816
00:58:26.771 --> 00:58:28.773
(whispering)
Jesus, forgive me.

817
00:58:32.076 --> 00:58:33.944
(sobs)
What am I doing?

818
00:58:39.016 --> 00:58:40.951
I'm so sorry.

819
00:58:50.928 --> 00:58:53.898
I ask this for Wayne's sake.

820
00:59:02.206 --> 00:59:04.074
Be a dad to him.

821
00:59:31.802 --> 00:59:32.970
All right,
I need a perimeter.

822
00:59:37.041 --> 00:59:39.343
How long
do you think it's been
since they were here?

823
00:59:39.376 --> 00:59:42.312
I don't know. Hard to tell.
Probably a few hours.
Fire's still going.

824
00:59:42.346 --> 00:59:44.949
What's that smell?

825
00:59:47.017 --> 00:59:49.119
EDDIE:
Don't touch that, Stevie.

826
00:59:52.256 --> 00:59:54.792
Check that tent there,
Shears.

827
00:59:56.393 --> 00:59:58.128
It's clear.

828
00:59:58.162 --> 01:00:00.865
- Rigby?
- Clear.

829
01:00:03.801 --> 01:00:06.136
Looks like
it's pretty clear, Sarge.

830
01:00:14.178 --> 01:00:16.146
What's wrong, sir?

831
01:00:20.217 --> 01:00:22.987
I don't know.

832
01:00:35.432 --> 01:00:37.134
Blood trail.

833
01:01:01.125 --> 01:01:03.293
SARGE: All right, boys.
Take five, cover and conceal.

834
01:01:03.327 --> 01:01:05.195
Move.

835
01:01:11.969 --> 01:01:14.204
Which one of y'all
is John Wayne?

836
01:01:14.238 --> 01:01:16.140
I'm John, that's Wayne.

837
01:01:16.173 --> 01:01:17.908
John Paul George?

838
01:01:17.942 --> 01:01:19.343
Yeah, that's me.

839
01:01:19.376 --> 01:01:22.012
- Like the Beatles.
- Yes.

840
01:01:22.046 --> 01:01:25.015
- Three first names.
- That's what I said.

841
01:01:25.049 --> 01:01:26.383
Hey!

842
01:01:26.416 --> 01:01:29.319
Free to go.
Check out at the desk
for your belongings.

843
01:01:29.353 --> 01:01:31.188
(buzzer sounds)

844
01:01:34.358 --> 01:01:37.928
What, do you like it in here?
Let's go, scoot! Come on.

845
01:01:45.169 --> 01:01:47.137
Wayne Richard Adams.

846
01:01:48.372 --> 01:01:52.076
Free to go.
Check out at the desk
for your belongings.

847
01:01:56.046 --> 01:01:58.282
Let's go. Come on.
I don't got all day.

848
01:02:02.519 --> 01:02:04.922
** (humming)

849
01:02:04.955 --> 01:02:07.224
Morning, boys.
Hi.

850
01:02:07.257 --> 01:02:09.359
Sign there.

851
01:02:09.393 --> 01:02:11.128
That car
was reported stolen.

852
01:02:11.161 --> 01:02:13.263
They dumped it into the yard
two days ago.

853
01:02:13.297 --> 01:02:16.266
Sent one of the boys out
to check things out last night.

854
01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:18.969
Apparently, that little girl
put that sign on the car

855
01:02:19.003 --> 01:02:21.305
just before you two showed up.

856
01:02:21.338 --> 01:02:25.142
Say that makes her
a pretty smart little twig,
wouldn't you?

857
01:02:25.175 --> 01:02:27.211
Figures.
Go on. Get out of here.

858
01:02:37.287 --> 01:02:39.023
(siren blares)

859
01:02:46.130 --> 01:02:47.697
Get down!

860
01:02:51.568 --> 01:02:54.338
They let you go.
You're free.

861
01:02:54.371 --> 01:02:56.406
They'll realize
their mistake
soon enough.

862
01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:58.208
I'm not going back.

863
01:02:58.242 --> 01:03:01.211
Wayne, I really think
God's protecting us.

864
01:03:01.245 --> 01:03:03.547
I've been praying about it,
and look what just happened.

865
01:03:03.580 --> 01:03:05.983
Oh, you prayed.
Oh, good. Thanks, man.

866
01:03:06.016 --> 01:03:07.384
Everything's gonna
be just fine.

867
01:03:07.417 --> 01:03:11.155
How much money you got left?
You want the last letter?

868
01:03:11.188 --> 01:03:14.024
I don't have any money.
You have all my money.

869
01:03:14.058 --> 01:03:16.160
What, you giving up?

870
01:03:19.396 --> 01:03:24.234
- You want the last letter?
- Wayne, I don't have any money.

871
01:03:24.268 --> 01:03:27.972
I have just enough
for a bus ticket home
and that's it.

872
01:03:30.274 --> 01:03:31.942
Ringo.

873
01:03:36.446 --> 01:03:38.415
Fine.
I'll get you the money.

874
01:03:38.448 --> 01:03:40.317
Let me see it.

875
01:03:41.385 --> 01:03:43.553
I don't have it on me.

876
01:03:43.587 --> 01:03:46.023
Of course. See you later.

877
01:03:47.157 --> 01:03:48.358
Ringo.

878
01:03:50.294 --> 01:03:51.996
Ringo!

879
01:04:01.538 --> 01:04:04.041
SARGE:
Little Elf to Big Dragon.

880
01:04:04.074 --> 01:04:06.110
We are at Checkpoint Alpha.

881
01:04:06.143 --> 01:04:09.146
Be advised we do not have
a visual on our plane.

882
01:04:09.179 --> 01:04:11.215
Do you read me? Over.

883
01:04:14.051 --> 01:04:16.020
(sighs)

884
01:04:16.053 --> 01:04:19.323
Henderson,
you keep working that radio
till we find our plane.

885
01:04:19.356 --> 01:04:21.291
I'm on it, Sarge.

886
01:04:31.235 --> 01:04:33.203
Hey.

887
01:04:33.237 --> 01:04:35.072
What?

888
01:04:35.105 --> 01:04:37.107
Do you, uh--

889
01:04:37.141 --> 01:04:39.576
Do you have
a piece of paper?

890
01:04:39.609 --> 01:04:41.645
I'll give you a piece
of my Bible.

891
01:04:41.678 --> 01:04:44.148
Why, you feel
like writing something?

892
01:04:45.549 --> 01:04:48.152
Yeah.

893
01:05:06.070 --> 01:05:07.437
Thanks.

894
01:05:37.701 --> 01:05:40.370
Dear, uh-- Dear Wayne,

895
01:05:44.208 --> 01:05:46.343
I'm in a lot of trouble.

896
01:05:54.584 --> 01:05:56.420
Don't be like me.

897
01:05:57.554 --> 01:05:59.489
I'm not writing that.

898
01:06:02.726 --> 01:06:04.494
He should be so lucky.

899
01:06:08.665 --> 01:06:11.468
I don't know what to write.

900
01:06:13.270 --> 01:06:15.539
Speak from the heart.

901
01:06:21.645 --> 01:06:24.681
You know, I, uh--

902
01:06:24.714 --> 01:06:29.553
I always struggled
with my belief in God.

903
01:06:33.523 --> 01:06:38.328
Lately, I've been--
I been thinking about
thinking about it.

904
01:06:45.269 --> 01:06:49.306
You know, there's
a verse in here that says,
"If you seek, you will find."

905
01:06:51.375 --> 01:06:53.243
Do you know
what you'll find?

906
01:06:55.279 --> 01:06:58.182
- What?
- Jesus.

907
01:06:59.683 --> 01:07:02.786
He can heal every hurt,

908
01:07:02.819 --> 01:07:06.223
every ounce of pain
that you feel,

909
01:07:06.256 --> 01:07:08.425
every wrong act
that you ever did.

910
01:07:08.458 --> 01:07:12.429
He died on the cross
just for you, Eddie.

911
01:07:18.835 --> 01:07:21.171
Why would he do that?

912
01:07:23.407 --> 01:07:24.608
Why me?

913
01:07:25.609 --> 01:07:27.544
He loves you,

914
01:07:29.479 --> 01:07:30.680
selflessly.

915
01:07:33.583 --> 01:07:36.253
And he wants to spend
an eternity with you

916
01:07:37.754 --> 01:07:40.324
in a place where
there is no more pain,

917
01:07:42.326 --> 01:07:44.394
no more fighting,

918
01:07:45.529 --> 01:07:47.397
no separation.

919
01:07:49.599 --> 01:07:52.536
He loves you as much
as you love Wayne,

920
01:07:53.737 --> 01:07:57.541
and he died for you
just like you would die
for Wayne.

921
01:08:02.479 --> 01:08:04.581
I don't wanna die
out here, Stevie.

922
01:08:08.552 --> 01:08:10.687
The things
that he's seen me do--

923
01:08:14.458 --> 01:08:16.693
I don't think
he could forgive me.

924
01:08:18.395 --> 01:08:20.530
Well, that's the beauty
of our Father.

925
01:08:20.564 --> 01:08:24.734
If you confess your sins,
Jesus will be faithful and just

926
01:08:24.768 --> 01:08:26.503
to forgive us of our sins

927
01:08:26.536 --> 01:08:29.273
and offer us
an eternal life in heaven.

928
01:08:40.584 --> 01:08:42.619
Will you be there?

929
01:08:44.921 --> 01:08:46.656
Yeah.

930
01:08:48.858 --> 01:08:51.661
And so can you.

931
01:08:51.695 --> 01:08:54.298
You and me here,

932
01:08:54.931 --> 01:08:57.301
it's temporary.

933
01:08:59.536 --> 01:09:02.706
But paradise with him
is eternity.

934
01:09:10.514 --> 01:09:13.317
MAN (on radio):
Hello. This is Big Dragon.
Over.

935
01:09:19.756 --> 01:09:21.758
Big Dragon?

936
01:09:21.791 --> 01:09:24.494
We are
at Checkpoint Alpha.

937
01:09:24.528 --> 01:09:27.431
We are about to
proceed to target.
Can you read me?

938
01:09:31.368 --> 01:09:33.403
CYNTHIA:
I love you, John Paul George.

939
01:09:33.437 --> 01:09:36.406
I'm sorry that I gave you
an ultimatum.

940
01:09:36.440 --> 01:09:38.742
- Will you forgive me?
- Yeah.

941
01:09:41.545 --> 01:09:43.613
I would be mad at me too.

942
01:09:45.949 --> 01:09:48.518
This-- This trip, you know--

943
01:09:48.552 --> 01:09:52.756
Listen, you are so much
more important to me
than this wedding.

944
01:09:54.458 --> 01:09:57.594
I want you to take
as much time as you need.

945
01:09:59.563 --> 01:10:01.798
How did I get so lucky?
(chuckles)

946
01:10:03.900 --> 01:10:06.736
You know,
I was just on my way--

947
01:10:13.377 --> 01:10:15.345
Are you okay?
Are you there?

948
01:10:17.881 --> 01:10:21.418
Honey, I gotta go.
I love you. I gotta go.
Stop the bus!

949
01:10:21.451 --> 01:10:23.487
(car engine starts)

950
01:10:40.970 --> 01:10:43.507
Put your hands
on the counter, old-timer.

951
01:10:43.540 --> 01:10:47.010
This is my store.
It's not a company franchise.

952
01:10:47.043 --> 01:10:49.679
Just open the drawer.

953
01:10:54.050 --> 01:10:56.520
Wayne Adams!

954
01:10:56.553 --> 01:10:59.389
Put the gun down
and your hands on your head.

955
01:11:00.990 --> 01:11:02.826
(places gun on counter)

956
01:11:05.829 --> 01:11:08.465
- Wayne?
- Don't move.

957
01:11:09.533 --> 01:11:11.635
You just keep selling me out,
huh, Ringo?

958
01:11:11.668 --> 01:11:15.405
On your knees.
Get on your knees, now.

959
01:11:19.909 --> 01:11:21.811
Plastic gun, huh?

960
01:11:29.085 --> 01:11:32.422
Up, nice and slow.

961
01:11:46.570 --> 01:11:48.672
Get in the car, son.
What, me?

962
01:11:52.709 --> 01:11:54.778
(sighs)

963
01:11:54.811 --> 01:11:56.580
It's funny, you know.

964
01:11:56.613 --> 01:11:58.882
You even sound
like your dad.

965
01:12:00.550 --> 01:12:02.552
What'd you just say?

966
01:12:02.586 --> 01:12:05.955
When I heard the call about
two young men in possession
of a stolen vehicle

967
01:12:05.989 --> 01:12:09.659
on the way to the Vietnam Wall
to visit their dead fathers,

968
01:12:09.693 --> 01:12:11.895
I didn't think much of it,

969
01:12:11.928 --> 01:12:14.764
until I heard your names.

970
01:12:14.798 --> 01:12:18.735
Wayne Adams
and John Paul George.

971
01:12:20.804 --> 01:12:23.873
I was your dads' sergeant
in the 25th.

972
01:12:40.890 --> 01:12:44.928
Well, once I recognized
the names, sure.

973
01:12:44.961 --> 01:12:48.798
See, your dads talked about
the two of you an awful lot.

974
01:12:48.832 --> 01:12:52.836
The things they wanted to do
when you boys got older.

975
01:12:52.869 --> 01:12:55.539
It was those kind
of good thoughts

976
01:12:55.572 --> 01:12:57.807
that helped them survive
during combat.

977
01:12:58.908 --> 01:13:01.545
I wanted
to meet you guys, too,
one day.

978
01:13:02.579 --> 01:13:04.714
What do you know?
Here we are.

979
01:13:04.748 --> 01:13:06.716
What do you know
about your dad, Wayne?

980
01:13:08.585 --> 01:13:11.020
I don't know. Just...

981
01:13:11.054 --> 01:13:13.122
been reading
his letters and stuff.

982
01:13:13.156 --> 01:13:16.793
He was a tough man,
like you.

983
01:13:18.762 --> 01:13:21.665
(sighs)
Pain in my butt,
I'll tell ya.

984
01:13:21.698 --> 01:13:24.033
Picked a lot of fights,
but he won most of 'em.

985
01:13:25.101 --> 01:13:27.537
Yeah?
Yeah.

986
01:13:29.138 --> 01:13:31.941
So, what happens now?

987
01:13:31.975 --> 01:13:35.178
With, you know, the store.

988
01:13:35.211 --> 01:13:37.681
Don't worry about all that.

989
01:13:37.714 --> 01:13:40.584
Chuck's a friend of mine.
We go to church together.

990
01:13:40.617 --> 01:13:42.752
I'll talk to him.
He'll do what I say.

991
01:13:42.786 --> 01:13:44.788
It's a good thing
that gun wasn't real,

992
01:13:44.821 --> 01:13:47.757
or you'd be looking
at armed robbery.

993
01:13:47.791 --> 01:13:50.760
Now, your dad, John--

994
01:13:50.794 --> 01:13:53.597
All he did
was talk about God
all the time.

995
01:13:53.630 --> 01:13:55.865
Made me crazy.

996
01:13:55.899 --> 01:13:58.935
I wanted to get him
kicked off my squad.

997
01:13:58.968 --> 01:14:02.038
- Bet you didn't know that.
- No, sir.

998
01:14:02.071 --> 01:14:04.107
But I'll tell you something.

999
01:14:04.140 --> 01:14:08.845
I learned a lot from him.
Things that changed my life.

1000
01:14:11.014 --> 01:14:16.586
See, most men think
that their life only matters
while they're alive.

1001
01:14:16.620 --> 01:14:20.056
But some of the greatest men
I've ever known
are already gone.

1002
01:14:20.089 --> 01:14:21.825
Your dads are two of 'em.

1003
01:14:24.961 --> 01:14:27.731
I never thought too much
about God.

1004
01:14:28.765 --> 01:14:30.867
I wanted what
I wanted out of this life

1005
01:14:30.900 --> 01:14:33.002
and pretty much got it
all on my own.

1006
01:14:36.139 --> 01:14:39.175
But I've learned that,
at some point,

1007
01:14:39.208 --> 01:14:41.945
each and every man

1008
01:14:41.978 --> 01:14:44.814
figures out that
there's a void deep down
inside their soul.

1009
01:14:47.884 --> 01:14:50.086
There's nothing in this world
that can fill it.

1010
01:14:52.789 --> 01:14:55.058
About 10 years ago,
I hit that point.

1011
01:14:57.293 --> 01:14:59.896
My wife passed away,

1012
01:15:02.198 --> 01:15:04.768
and that deep void came,

1013
01:15:07.704 --> 01:15:10.139
and I questioned God.

1014
01:15:13.009 --> 01:15:15.912
Everything in my life
seemed like sand.

1015
01:15:16.946 --> 01:15:19.048
And then the words
of your dad, John,

1016
01:15:19.082 --> 01:15:22.051
came roaring back to me.

1017
01:15:23.753 --> 01:15:25.789
I remember him saying,

1018
01:15:25.822 --> 01:15:28.725
"It's the foolish man that
builds his castle on the sand

1019
01:15:28.758 --> 01:15:31.795
and the wise man
that builds it on the rock."

1020
01:15:33.262 --> 01:15:35.031
I'll never forget that.

1021
01:15:37.166 --> 01:15:41.705
I learned that a man doesn't
have to die when he dies.

1022
01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:46.810
Stephen George taught me that.

1023
01:15:48.111 --> 01:15:51.114
See, I'd heard about Jesus,
but I didn't know him.

1024
01:15:53.850 --> 01:15:56.185
It wasn't until I started
to understand all that

1025
01:15:56.219 --> 01:15:58.154
that my life changed.

1026
01:16:02.091 --> 01:16:04.961
(exhales)
Thank God.

1027
01:16:06.996 --> 01:16:09.833
You two come with me.
I want to show you something.

1028
01:16:13.102 --> 01:16:16.305
Now, this, gentlemen,
is some of the treasure

1029
01:16:16.339 --> 01:16:18.107
that I've stored up
here on earth.

1030
01:16:18.141 --> 01:16:21.210
Hopefully, the good Lord
will forgive me.

1031
01:16:21.244 --> 01:16:23.179
I'm sure he will.

1032
01:16:23.212 --> 01:16:25.148
You like that?

1033
01:16:27.016 --> 01:16:28.351
Yes, sir.

1034
01:16:28.384 --> 01:16:30.854
Good. Here, take it.

1035
01:16:39.395 --> 01:16:41.097
No way.

1036
01:16:42.799 --> 01:16:44.367
Mr. Mansfield,
I'm not sure what--

1037
01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:46.235
Be sure, son.

1038
01:16:46.269 --> 01:16:49.839
Why are you two here?
What'd you set out to do?

1039
01:16:49.873 --> 01:16:52.241
We set out
to go to the wall.

1040
01:16:56.212 --> 01:16:58.147
A gift.

1041
01:16:58.181 --> 01:17:01.751
Sometimes one
of the hardest things to do
is just simply accept it.

1042
01:17:06.856 --> 01:17:09.058
Take it
before I change my mind.

1043
01:17:12.428 --> 01:17:14.197
I accept it.

1044
01:17:16.032 --> 01:17:20.169
Mr. Mansfield,
how did my dad die?

1045
01:17:25.174 --> 01:17:27.877
MANSFIELD:
We were on the last night
of a mission

1046
01:17:27.911 --> 01:17:30.146
to recover a downed
American flight crew.

1047
01:17:31.815 --> 01:17:34.150
Both your dads
were on point together.

1048
01:17:34.183 --> 01:17:36.886
What's the plan here,
Sergeant Mansfield?

1049
01:17:36.920 --> 01:17:39.022
You boys stay here.
I'm gonna go in.

1050
01:17:40.156 --> 01:17:41.991
Let me go, Sarge.

1051
01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:47.296
You sure, Adams?
Yes, Sarge.

1052
01:17:47.330 --> 01:17:49.232
- Shears?
- Sarge.

1053
01:17:51.067 --> 01:17:53.903
- I got your back.
- No, you're staying
right here, Stevie.

1054
01:17:53.937 --> 01:17:55.939
Not a chance.

1055
01:17:58.942 --> 01:18:01.210
MANSFIELD:
Boys, be careful now.

1056
01:18:01.244 --> 01:18:03.312
Yes, sir, Sarge.

1057
01:18:03.346 --> 01:18:06.115
Will you hold this
for me, Sarge?

1058
01:18:06.149 --> 01:18:07.951
You got it.

1059
01:18:08.351 --> 01:18:10.253
Stay to my left.

1060
01:18:10.286 --> 01:18:12.155
Stay alert. Stay alert.

1061
01:18:12.188 --> 01:18:14.858
Thank you, Sarge.

1062
01:18:22.365 --> 01:18:25.368
All right. All right.
I'm going in there, Stevie.

1063
01:18:25.401 --> 01:18:28.271
You cover me.
Okay. I got you.

1064
01:18:28.304 --> 01:18:30.039
Go!

1065
01:18:51.127 --> 01:18:52.161
Eddie?

1066
01:18:53.396 --> 01:18:57.100
Eddie? How's it look?

1067
01:19:00.436 --> 01:19:03.106
(panting)

1068
01:19:07.210 --> 01:19:08.377
Oh, no.

1069
01:19:08.411 --> 01:19:10.980
Get back.

1070
01:19:11.014 --> 01:19:13.349
Eddie, that's attached
to claymores.

1071
01:19:16.052 --> 01:19:18.922
I'm gonna get some bamboo
and prop that wire.

1072
01:19:18.955 --> 01:19:20.289
Don't move.

1073
01:19:25.962 --> 01:19:27.530
Henderson?
Sarge.

1074
01:19:27.563 --> 01:19:30.967
I'm going in.
You stay on that radio.
You got it, Sarge.

1075
01:19:41.177 --> 01:19:44.313
All right.
I'm coming in behind you.
Carefully.

1076
01:19:48.584 --> 01:19:51.320
Hold still.

1077
01:19:51.354 --> 01:19:53.322
Here we go.

1078
01:19:55.458 --> 01:19:57.460
(gasps)

1079
01:19:57.493 --> 01:20:00.296
- (screams)
- Stevie!

1080
01:20:00.329 --> 01:20:02.932
Adams, get out of there now!
That's an order!

1081
01:20:02.966 --> 01:20:04.968
Hang on!

1082
01:20:07.470 --> 01:20:10.073
Stevie, you hang on, man.

1083
01:20:10.106 --> 01:20:12.175
You're gonna make it.
Come on, come on!

1084
01:20:17.213 --> 01:20:18.214
Hang on.

1085
01:20:23.352 --> 01:20:24.387
(gasps)

1086
01:20:38.501 --> 01:20:40.203
Need to get on your feet!

1087
01:20:42.305 --> 01:20:44.140
Come on, let's go!

1088
01:20:47.510 --> 01:20:49.612
(grunts, coughs)

1089
01:20:49.645 --> 01:20:52.281
Stay low. I'll be back.

1090
01:20:52.315 --> 01:20:55.484
(coughs)

1091
01:20:55.518 --> 01:20:59.488
Hey, man.
You still there?

1092
01:20:59.522 --> 01:21:01.290
Yeah.

1093
01:21:02.425 --> 01:21:04.393
You take that for me?

1094
01:21:05.461 --> 01:21:07.363
No, man, I slipped.

1095
01:21:07.396 --> 01:21:08.531
(laughing)

1096
01:21:08.564 --> 01:21:10.266
(coughing)

1097
01:21:13.136 --> 01:21:17.140
Hey, uh, do you--

1098
01:21:19.442 --> 01:21:23.412
Do you think I still have time
to make that choice?

1099
01:21:24.447 --> 01:21:26.415
(coughing)

1100
01:21:27.516 --> 01:21:32.155
You think Jesus won't think
I cheated on him?

1101
01:21:33.356 --> 01:21:35.058
No.

1102
01:21:37.126 --> 01:21:39.595
When Jesus died
on the cross,

1103
01:21:39.628 --> 01:21:42.265
a thief asked him
the same thing.

1104
01:21:43.399 --> 01:21:47.336
Well, what did he say?

1105
01:21:51.374 --> 01:21:54.210
"On this day,

1106
01:21:54.243 --> 01:21:57.246
you will be with me
in paradise."

1107
01:22:00.149 --> 01:22:01.384
(gunfire)

1108
01:22:04.687 --> 01:22:07.090
(shouting)

1109
01:22:13.362 --> 01:22:16.132
(gunfire continues)
Forgive me, Jesus.

1110
01:22:16.165 --> 01:22:18.534
I'll see you
in paradise, Steve.

1111
01:22:32.215 --> 01:22:35.318
Your fathers died bravely,
serving their country.

1112
01:22:37.453 --> 01:22:40.356
When I got back to the States,
I called your mother, John,

1113
01:22:40.389 --> 01:22:43.192
let her know I had
Stephen's last letter.

1114
01:22:45.328 --> 01:22:48.364
She asked me to hold on to it
until she was ready. I--

1115
01:22:50.333 --> 01:22:53.302
I guess it was just
a little too emotional for her.

1116
01:22:55.538 --> 01:22:58.241
Then I'd learned she'd passed,

1117
01:22:58.274 --> 01:23:01.310
so after a while I thought
it'd be all right to open it up.

1118
01:23:01.344 --> 01:23:03.579
That's when I learned
it wasn't written to her.

1119
01:23:05.714 --> 01:23:07.483
It was written to you.

1120
01:23:36.645 --> 01:23:38.347
(sighs)

1121
01:23:41.817 --> 01:23:44.187
STEPHEN'S VOICE:
Dear John Paul,

1122
01:23:45.754 --> 01:23:49.325
I may seem
far away from you,

1123
01:23:49.358 --> 01:23:51.627
but I think about you
every day.

1124
01:23:54.597 --> 01:23:58.501
I wanted to tell you
not to be afraid
of life's journey.

1125
01:24:00.303 --> 01:24:03.539
You will have
both good times and bad,

1126
01:24:03.572 --> 01:24:06.509
but know that God is there
through them all.

1127
01:24:09.312 --> 01:24:12.248
He loves you more
than I ever could, John Paul,

1128
01:24:12.281 --> 01:24:14.650
and I love you
with all my heart.

1129
01:24:16.785 --> 01:24:19.455
I'm already so proud of you.

1130
01:24:21.324 --> 01:24:24.460
I'm proud that God
gave you to me and your mom.

1131
01:24:27.530 --> 01:24:29.498
And know that you've got
my biggest blessing

1132
01:24:29.532 --> 01:24:32.368
to be
who God intends you to be.

1133
01:24:34.703 --> 01:24:37.573
No matter what, Son,

1134
01:24:37.606 --> 01:24:39.775
know that I love you

1135
01:24:39.808 --> 01:24:42.378
and that Jesus loves you.

1136
01:24:43.879 --> 01:24:48.351
You can trust him
with your heart, John Paul,
just as I have.

1137
01:24:49.485 --> 01:24:52.288
I can't wait to see you again.

1138
01:24:54.757 --> 01:24:56.492
Until then.

1139
01:24:58.461 --> 01:25:00.229
Love, Dad.

1140
01:25:25.288 --> 01:25:28.491
MAN, WOMAN:
* The winds have changed

1141
01:25:29.792 --> 01:25:33.629
* I think I'm headed
for a breakthrough *

1142
01:25:33.662 --> 01:25:36.432
* In my life

1143
01:25:38.867 --> 01:25:41.704
* The weather's clearing

1144
01:25:43.539 --> 01:25:46.375
* God knows
I've been haunted *

1145
01:25:46.409 --> 01:25:50.546
* By this lingering storm

1146
01:25:54.550 --> 01:26:00.389
* Afraid of coming undone

1147
01:26:00.423 --> 01:26:06.529
* It's been a long, long time

1148
01:26:07.530 --> 01:26:13.302
* Since I've looked inside

1149
01:26:13.336 --> 01:26:16.939
* Do I really want to see

1150
01:26:16.972 --> 01:26:20.309
* Myself?

1151
01:26:21.510 --> 01:26:24.413
* Do I? Do I?

1152
01:26:24.447 --> 01:26:27.450
- What is this?
- * Do I?

1153
01:26:57.913 --> 01:27:04.887
* This rearranging desires

1154
01:27:04.920 --> 01:27:12.495
* Unraveling these wires

1155
01:27:14.430 --> 01:27:21.404
* It takes a long, long time

1156
01:27:21.437 --> 01:27:26.875
* To see what's inside
(exhales)

1157
01:27:26.909 --> 01:27:28.844
It's your last letter.

1158
01:27:30.946 --> 01:27:33.416
Free of charge.

1159
01:27:35.851 --> 01:27:39.755
* Do I? Do I?

1160
01:27:39.788 --> 01:27:43.592
* Do I?

1161
01:27:43.626 --> 01:27:45.728
No.

1162
01:27:45.761 --> 01:27:48.531
It's addressed to you.
* Amen

1163
01:27:51.534 --> 01:27:53.702
You should read it.

1164
01:27:56.439 --> 01:27:58.541
(sighs)

1165
01:28:02.945 --> 01:28:04.813
"Dear Wayne,

1166
01:28:07.015 --> 01:28:09.084
This is your dad.

1167
01:28:12.955 --> 01:28:15.558
I don't really know
what to say.

1168
01:28:16.892 --> 01:28:19.695
I've always struggled
with my belief in God.

1169
01:28:21.830 --> 01:28:24.567
But I'm thinking
about thinking about it.

1170
01:28:27.870 --> 01:28:31.874
There's a verse
that my friend Stephen
keeps telling me about."

1171
01:28:33.842 --> 01:28:36.745
Your dad got my dad
to read the Bible?

1172
01:28:45.888 --> 01:28:49.458
"'If you confess your sins--'"
(sniffles)

1173
01:28:51.760 --> 01:28:55.731
"'Jesus is faithful and just
to forgive us our sin

1174
01:28:55.764 --> 01:28:58.601
and to cleanse us
from all unrighteousness.'

1175
01:29:01.003 --> 01:29:02.705
Ain't that something?

1176
01:29:08.677 --> 01:29:11.113
Because he loves you,

1177
01:29:11.146 --> 01:29:13.916
he loves you
as much as I love you,

1178
01:29:17.019 --> 01:29:19.688
and he died for you

1179
01:29:19.722 --> 01:29:22.525
just like I would die
for you, Wayne.

1180
01:29:25.127 --> 01:29:28.597
I asked Stevie what's next,

1181
01:29:28.631 --> 01:29:32.568
and he told me that's exactly
what God is waiting for.

1182
01:29:32.601 --> 01:29:34.803
What will I choose next?

1183
01:29:39.642 --> 01:29:41.944
There's a lot more
I want to say,

1184
01:29:44.046 --> 01:29:46.515
but now's not the time.

1185
01:29:58.661 --> 01:30:00.763
I love you, Wayne,

1186
01:30:02.064 --> 01:30:04.032
and I miss you.

1187
01:30:06.769 --> 01:30:08.637
Dad."

1188
01:30:26.088 --> 01:30:28.023
(crying)

1189
01:30:38.734 --> 01:30:40.803
I love you too, Daddy.

1190
01:30:51.113 --> 01:30:53.716
This is my father's Bible.

1191
01:30:58.120 --> 01:31:00.088
May I?

1192
01:31:00.122 --> 01:31:01.857
Of course.

1193
01:32:18.166 --> 01:32:20.869
JOHN:
At some point in life,
everyone struggles

1194
01:32:20.903 --> 01:32:23.105
to understand
who they really are.

1195
01:32:24.807 --> 01:32:28.076
For me, it started with
wondering who my dad was.

1196
01:32:30.078 --> 01:32:32.247
On this journey,
I learned that he loved me,

1197
01:32:32.280 --> 01:32:36.318
and his example
gave me a glimpse
of something far greater.

1198
01:32:36.351 --> 01:32:39.187
I have a heavenly Father
who loves me more

1199
01:32:39.221 --> 01:32:41.924
than an earthly father
ever could.

1200
01:32:41.957 --> 01:32:44.192
That's what my dad taught me

1201
01:32:44.226 --> 01:32:46.962
on the way to the wall.
